Contents [ hide ] 1 History 2 Example of use 3 Related signs 4 See also 5 References History [ edit ] According to Cajori , A History of Mathematical Notations, Johann Rahn used both the therefore and because signs to mean \"therefore\"; in the German edition of Teutsche Algebra (1659) the therefore sign was prevalent with the modern meaning, but in the 1668 English edition Rahn used the because sign more often to mean \"therefore\". [1] Other authors in the eighteenth century also used three dots in a triangle shape to signify \"therefore,\" but as with Rahn, there wasn't much in the way of consistency as to how the triangle was oriented; because with its current meaning appears to have originated in the nineteenth century. In this century, the three-dot notation for therefore became very rare in continental Europe, but it remains popular in the British Isles. [2] Example of use [ edit ] Used in a syllogism : All gods are immortal.

The inverted form \u2235, known as the because sign , is sometimes used as a shorthand form of \"because\". This is Unicode character U+2235. The therefore sign is sometimes used as a substitute for an asterism \u2042. In meteorology, the therefore sign is used to indicate moderate rain on a station model ; the asterism indicates moderate snow. To denote logical implication or entailment , various signs are used in mathematical logic : \u2192, \u21d2, \u2283, \u22a2, \u22a8. These symbols are then part of a mathematical formula, and are not considered to be punctuation. In contrast, the therefore sign is traditionally used as a punctuation mark, and does not form part of a logical formula. [3] The graphically identical sign \u2234 serves as a Japanese map symbol on the maps of the Geographical Survey Institute of Japan , indicating a tea plantation. On other maps the sign, often with thicker dots, is sometimes used to signal the presence of a national monument or ruins . The character \u0b83 in the Tamil script represents the \u0101ytam , a special sound of the Tamil language . In Masonic traditions the symbol is used for abbreviation , instead of the usual period. For example \"R\u2234W\u2234 John Smith\" is an abbreviation for \"Right Worshipful John Smith\" (the term Right Worshipful is an archaic title just as \"Land Lord\" is and indicates that Brother Smith is a Grand Lodge officer). [4] In Norwegian and Danish , a similar symbol is used as an explanatory symbol ( forklaringstegnet ). It can be typeset using the open o followed by a colon, thus: \u0254: .

(Ezekiel 33:1-6) The existence of watchmen has also been found [ specify ] in the Ottoman , Greek and Egyptian Empires. [ citation needed ] The Roman Empire turned the role of a watchman into a profession by creating two organizations: the Praetorian Guard thus establishing a rank and file system with a Captain of the Guard. Vigiles , literally the watch. Watchmen in England [ edit ] The Problem of the Night [ edit ] The streets in London were dark and had a shortage of and poor quality artificial light. [1] It had been recognized for centuries that the coming of darkness to the unlit streets of a town brought a heightened threat of danger, and that the night provided cover to the disorderly and immoral, and to those bent on robbery or burglary or who in other ways threatened physical harm to people in the streets and in their houses. [2] The anxieties that darkness gave rise to had been met by the formation of a night watch in the 13th century, and by the rules about who could use the streets after dark. These rules had for long been underpinned in London and other towns by the curfew , the time (announced by the ringing of a bell) at which the gates closed and the streets were cleared. Only people with good reason to be abroad could then travel through the City. [1] Anyone outside at night without reason or permission was suspicious and potentially criminal. [3] Allowances were usually made for people who had some social status on their side. Lord Fielding clearly expected to pass through London's streets untroubled at 1 am one night in 1641, and he quickly became piqued when his coach was stopped by the watch, shouting huffily that it was a 'disgrace' to stop someone of such high standing as he, and telling the constable in charge of the watch that he would box him on the ears if he did not let his coach carry on back to his house. 'It is impossible' to 'distinguish a lord from another man by the outside of a coach', the constable said later in his defence, 'especially at unreasonable times'. [4] Formation of Watchmen [ edit ] The Ordinance of 1233 required the appointment of watchmen. [5] [6] The Assize of Arms of 1252 , which required the appointment of constables to summon men to arms, quell breaches of the peace , and to deliver offenders to the sheriff , is cited as one of the earliest creations of an English police force, as was the Statute of Winchester of 1285. [7] [8] [9] In 1252 a royal writ established a Watch and Ward with royal officers appointed as Shire Reeves : By order of the King of England the Winchester Act Mandating The Watch. Part Four and the King commandth that from henceforth all Watches be made as it hath been used in past times that was to wit from the day of Ascension unto the day of St. Michael [10] in every city by six men at every gate in every borough by twelve men in every town by six or four according to the number of inhabitants of the town. They shall keep the Watch all night from sun setting unto sun rising. And if any stranger do pass them by them he shall be arrested until morning and if no suspicion be found he shall go quit. Later in 1279 King Edward I formed a special guard of 20 sergeants at arms who carried decorated battle maces as a badge of official office. By 1415 a watch was appointed to the Parliament of England and in 1485 King Henry VII established a household watch that became known as the Beefeaters . After 1660 it seems that large numbers of men had avoided night-time service by paying for a substitute well before 1660. Substitution had become so common by the late 17th century that the night watch was virtually by then a fully paid force. [11] In October 1663 was promulgated an act of Common Council, known as 'Robinson's Act' from the name of the sitting lord mayor, that confirmed the duty of all householders in the City to take their turn at watching in order 'to keep the peace and apprehend night-walkers, malefactors and suspected persons'. For the most part the Common Council Act of 1663 reiterated the rules and obligations that had long existed. The number of watchmen required for each ward, it declared, was to be the number 'established by custom' \u2013 in fact, by an act of 1621. Even though it had been true before the civil war that the watch had already become a body of paid men, supported by what were in effect the fines collected from those with an obligation to serve, the Common Council did not acknowledge this in the confirming Act of 1663. [12] The act of 1663 confirmed that watch on its old foundations, and left its effective management to the ward authorities. The important matter to be arranged in the wards was who was going to serve and on what basis. How the money was to be collected to support a force of paid constables, and by whom, were crucial issues. The 1663 act left it to the ward beadle or a constable and it seems to have been increasingly the case that rather than individuals paying directly for a substitute, when their turn came to serve, the eligible householders were asked to contribute to a watch fund that supported hired man. [13] From the mid-1690s the City authorities made several attempts to replace Robinson's Act and establish the watch on a new footing. Though they did not say it directly, the overwhelming requirement was to get quotas adjusted to reflect the reality that the watch consisted of hired men rather than citizens doing their civic duty\u2014the assumption upon which the 1663 act, and all previous acts, had been based. [14] The implications and consequences of changes in the watch were worked out in practice and in legislation in two stages between the Restoration and the middle decades of the 18th century. The first involved the gradual recognition that a paid (and full-time) watch needed to be differently constituted from one made up of unpaid citizens, a point accepted in practice in legislation passed by the Common Council in 1705, though it was not articulated in as direct a way. [15] The fact that the 1705 act called for watchmen to be strong and able-bodied men seems further confirmation that the watch was now expected to be made up of hired hands rather than every male house holder serving in turn. The act of 1705 laid out the new quotas of watchmen and the disposition of watch-stands agreed to each ward. To discourage the corruption that had been blamed for earlier under-manning, it forbade constables to collect and disturbs the money paid in for hired watchmen: that was now supposed to be the responsibility of the deputy and common councilmen of the ward. [16] The second stage was the recognition that watchmen could not be sustained without a major shift in the way local services were financed. This led to the City's acquisition of taxing power by means of an act of parliament in 1737 which changed the obligation to serve in person into an obligation to pay to support a force of salaried man. [15] Under the new act, the ward authorities also continued to hire their own watchmen and to make whatever local rules seemed appropriate\u2014establishing, for example, the places in their wards where the watchmen would stand and the beats they would patrol. But the implementation of the new Watch Act did have the effect of imposing some uniformity on the watch over the whole City, making in the process some modest incursions into the local autonomy of the wards. One of the leading elements in the regime that emerged from the implementation of the new act was an agreement that every watchman would be paid the same amount and that the wages should be raised to thirteen pounds a year. [17] From 1485 to the 1820s, in the absence of a police force, it was the parish-based watchmen who were responsible for keeping order in London's streets. [1] Duties [ edit ] Night watchmen patrolled the streets between 9 or 10 pm until sunrise, and were expected to examine all suspicious characters. [18] Such controls continued to be exercised in the late 17th century. Guarding the streets to prevent crime, to watch out for fires, and \u2013 despite the absence of a formal curfew \u2013 to ensure that suspicious and unauthorized people did not prowl around under cover of darkness was still the duty of night watch and the constables who were supposed to command them. [19] The principal task of the watch in 1660 and for long after continued to be the control of the streets at night imposing a form of moral or social curfew that aimed to prevent those without legitimate reason to be abroad from wandering the streets at night. That task was becoming increasingly difficult in the 17th century because of the growth of the population and variety of ways in which the social and cultural life was being transformed. The shape of the urban day was being altered after the Restoration by the development of shops , taverns and coffee-houses , theatres , the opera and other places of entertainment. All these placed remained open in the evening and extended their hours of business and pleasure into the night. [20] The watch was affected by this changing urban world since policing the night streets become more complicated when larger number of people were moving around. And what was frequently thought to be poor quality of the watchman\u2014and in time, the lack of effective lighting\u2014came commonly to be blamed when street crimes and night-time disorders seemed to be growing out of control. [20] Traditionally, householders served in the office of constable by appointment or rotation. During their year of office they performed their duties part-time alongside their normal employment. Similarly, householders were expected to serve by rotation on the nightly watch. From the late seventeenth century, however, many householders avoided these obligations by hiring deputies to serve in their place. As this practice increased, some men were able to make a living out of acting as deputy constables or as paid night watchmen. In the case of the watch, this procedure was formalized in many parts of London by the passage of \"Watch Acts\", which replaced householders' duty of service by a tax levied specifically for the purpose of hiring full-time watchmen. Some voluntary prosecution societies also hired men to patrol their areas. [18] Reputation [ edit ] While the societies for the reformation of manners showed there was a good deal of support for the effective policing of morality, they also suggested that the existing mechanisms of crime control were regarded by some as ineffective. [21] Constable Dogberry's men from Much Ado About Nothing by Shakespeare would 'rather sleep than talk' may be dismissed as merely a dramatic device or a caricature, but successful dramatists nevertheless work with characters who strike a chord with their audience. A hundred years later such complaints were still commonplace. Daniel Defoe wrote four pamphlets and a broadsheet on the issue of street crime in which, among other things, he roundly attacked the efficacy of the watch and called for measures to ensure it 'be compos'd of stout, able-body'd Men, and of those a sufficient Number'. [22] Watchmen on roads leading to London had a reputation for clumsiness in the late 1580s. It was a temptation on cold winter nights to slip away early from watching stations to catch some sleep. Constables in charge sometimes let watches go home early. 'The late placing and early dischargering' of night-watches concerned Common Council in 1609 and again 3 decades later when someone sent out to spy on watches reported that they 'break up longe before they ought'. 'The greatest parte of constables' broke up watches 'earlie in the morninge' at exactly the time 'when most danger' was 'feared' in the long night, leaving the dark streets to thieves . [23] We can imagine watchmen on chilly nights counting off the hours until sunrise. Alehouses offered some warmth, even after curfew bells told people to drink up. A group of watchmen sneaked into a 'vitlers' house one night in 1617 and stayed 'drinking and taking tobacco all night longe'. [24] Like other officers, watchmen could become the focus for trouble themselves, adding to the hullabaloo at night instead of ordering others to keep the noise down and go to bed. And as by day, there were more than a few crooked officers policing the streets at night, quite happy to turn a blind eye to trouble for a bribe. Watchman Edward Gardener was taken before the recorder with 'a common nightwalker' \u2013 Mary Taylor \u2013 in 1641 after he 'tooke 2s to lett' her 'escape' when he was escorting her to Bridewell late at night. Another watchman from over the river in Southwark took advantage of the tricky situation people suddenly found themselves in if they stumbled into the watch, 'demanding money [from them] for passing the watch'. [24] Common complaint in the 1690s was that watchmen were inadequately armed. This was another aspect of the watch in the process of being transformed. The Common Council acts required watchmen to carry halberds essentially, a pike with an axe-blade attached\u2014and some were still doing so in the late seventeenth century. But it seems clear that few did, because the halberd was no longer suitable for the work they were being called upon to do. It was more often observed that watchmen failed to carry them, and it is surely the case that the halberd was no longer a useful weapon for a watch that was supposed to be mobile. By the second quarter of the 18th century, watchmen were equipped with a staff, along with their lantern. [25] Watch houses [ edit ] A rare and unusually fine Georgian Watchman's Box of about 1810. Bath , UK Another step in the right direction was building 'watch howses' as the country lurched towards revolution after 1640. A City committee was asked to look into the question 'what watchhouses are necessary' and where 'for the safety of this cittye' in 1642. Workmen began building watch houses in strategic spots soon after. They provided assembly-points for watchmen to gather to hear orders for the night ahead, somewhere to shelter from 'extremitye of wind and weather', and holding-placed for suspects until morning when justices examined the night's catch. There were watch houses next to Temple Bar (1648), 'neere the Granaryes' by Bridewell (1648), 'neere Moregate' (1648), and next to St Paul's south door (1649). They were not big; the one on St. Paul's side was 'a small house or shed'. This was a time of experimentation, and people (including those in authority) were learning how to make best use of these new structures in their midst. [26] Policing the Night Streets [ edit ] The watchmen patrolled the streets at night, calling out the hour, keeping a lookout for fires, checking that doors were locked and ensuring that drunks and other vagrants were delivered to the watch constable . [27] However, their low wages and the uncongenial nature of the job attracted a fairly low standard of person, and they acquired a possibly-exaggerated reputation for being old, ineffectual, feeble, drunk or asleep on the job. [28] London had a system of night policing in place before 1660, although it was improved over the next century through better lighting, administrations, finances, and better and more regular salaries. But the essential elements of the night-watch were performing completely by the middle of the seventeenth century. [29] During the 1820s, mounting crime levels and increasing political and industrial disorder prompted calls for reform, led by Sir Robert Peel , which culminated in the demise of the watchmen and their replacement by a uniformed metropolitan police force . [30] [31] Watchmen in the United States of America [ edit ] The first form of societal protection in the United States was based on practices developed in England. The City of Boston was the first settlement in the 13 colonies to establish a night watch in 1631. [2] New York (then New Amsterdam ) and Jamestown followed in 1658. Watchmen and modern police [ edit ] With the unification of laws and centralization of state power ( e.g. the Municipal Police Act of 1844 in New York City , United States ), such formations became increasingly incorporated into state-run police force (see metropolitan police and municipal police ). Watchmen still exist under Florida statutes and are recognised / given special dispensation in law.

Starr co-wrote the song with George Harrison , his former bandmate from the Beatles . Although the two of them collaborated on other compositions, it is the only song officially credited to the pair. A signature tune for Starr as a solo artist, \"Photograph\" became an international hit, topping singles charts in the United States, Canada and Australia, and receiving gold disc certification for US sales of 1 million. Music critics have similarly received the song favourably; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic considers it to be \"among the very best post-Beatles songs by any of the Fab Four\". [1] The lyrics are a reflection on lost love, whereby a photograph is the only reminder of the protagonists' shared past. Starr and Harrison began writing the song in the South of France in 1971, during a period when Starr was focused on developing his acting career. They first recorded \"Photograph\" late the following year, along with the single's B-side , \"Down and Out\", during sessions for Harrison's Living in the Material World album (1973). The officially released version was recorded in Los Angeles with producer Richard Perry , and it incorporates aspects of Phil Spector 's Wall of Sound through the presence of multiple drums and acoustic guitars, as well as an orchestra and a choir. Aside from Starr and Harrison, the musicians on the recording include Nicky Hopkins , Bobby Keys , Jim Keltner , and Spector's musical arranger, Jack Nitzsche . Starr made a promotional film for the single, shot at his and wife Maureen Starkey 's home, Tittenhurst Park . \"Photograph\" has appeared on Starr's compilation albums Blast from Your Past (1975) and Photograph: The Very Best of Ringo Starr (2007), and live versions have featured on releases recorded with his All-Starr Band and with the Roundheads. In November 2002, a year after Harrison's death, Starr sang \"Photograph\" at the Concert for George \u2013 a performance that was an emotional highpoint of the event. Engelbert Humperdinck , Camper Van Beethoven , Cilla Black and Adam Sandler are among the artists who have covered the song.

[2] [3] Starr had hired a yacht, the Marala , for the duration of the Cannes Film Festival , after attending Mick Jagger 's wedding in St Tropez with his wife, Maureen Starkey . [3] The Starkeys [nb 1] were then joined in France by Harrison and the latter's wife, Pattie Boyd , for the Monaco Grand Prix . [5] This period coincided with Starr's first success as a solo artist, with the Harrison-produced single \" It Don't Come Easy \", [6] although he would continue to focus on his career as a film actor, [7] [8] beginning with a role in Blindman (1971). [9] [nb 2] Another guest on the Marala was Cilla Black , singer and a friend to the Beatles since the 1960s, who recalls Starr and Harrison playing \"Photograph\" during an evening get-together, with \"everyone on board\" contributing ideas for the lyrics. [2] As with Starr's two singles over 1971\u201372, \"It Don't Come Easy\" and \" Back Off Boogaloo \", [14] Harrison helped write the melody, [15] [16] although \"Photograph\" would mark the first time that he was credited as a co-writer with Starr. [17] In her autobiography, Step Inside Love , Black says she had hoped to record the song for a single later in 1971, only to be told by Starr: \"No, it's too bloody good for you. I'm having it myself.\" [18] The lyric to \"Photograph\" is centred around lost love, [19] [20] with the singer having only a single picture by which to remember his absent lover. [16] The eponymous photograph reminds him of their former happiness together, while also enforcing the reality that \"you're not coming back any more\". [21] Author Ian Inglis comments on the familiar subject matter in the conventions of pop songwriting, but identifies an \"unusual\" aspect in the lyrics' \"absence of any hope that love might be rekindled\". [21] Starr expresses resignation at what the future holds, in the lines \"Now you're expecting me to live without you / But that's not something that I'm looking forward to\". [21] Musically, the song is in the key of E , [22] with what Inglis terms an \"easy melody\" that allows for Starr's limitations as a singer. [21] Harrison's \"distinctive composing style\" is particularly evident, according to authors Roy Carr and Tony Tyler , [23] and Starr would later say of Harrison's role in their collaborations over this period: \"I only know three chords and he'd stick four more in, and they'd all think I was a genius.\" [24] Recording [ edit ] Starr continued to pursue his film career until the end of 1972, [25] while also participating in musical projects such as Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh . [26] [nb 3] Late that year, Starr and Harrison recorded an early version of \"Photograph\" during the sessions for Harrison's Living in the Material World album (1973). [30] With Harrison producing, [10] this recording took place at either Apple Studio in central London, or Harrison's home studio, FPSHOT , in Oxfordshire. [31] [32] Starr re-recorded the song in March 1973, [33] while working at Sunset Sound Recorders in Los Angeles on Ringo , his first solo album in the rock [34] or contemporary pop style. [35] [nb 4] He later described Ringo as an \"accidental album\", since it only came about because he was attending the Grammy Awards in Nashville, where The Concert for Bangladesh won the Grammy for Best Album of 1972. [38] Keen to find another activity to justify the flight to the US, Starr arranged to record with American producer Richard Perry during the visit. [39] The recording engineer on \"Photograph\" was Bill Schnee, [11] and author Simon Leng suggests that Harrison helped \"hew\" the production. [40] Along with Starr (on drums) and Harrison (12-string acoustic guitar), the other musicians included Nicky Hopkins (piano), Klaus Voormann (bass) and Jim Keltner (drums), [41] all of whom had participated in the sessions for Material World . [42] In addition, Vini Poncia , Starr's new songwriting partner, [43] and session musician Jimmy Calvert played acoustic rhythm guitar on the Los Angeles recording. [44] Overdubs on the basic tracks recorded for Ringo took place from April to July 1973. [39] On \"Photograph\", the additional instrumentation included a saxophone solo by Bobby Keys [45] and percussion played by one of Harrison's Apple Records signings, brothers Lon and Derrek Van Eaton . [46] Harrison added harmony and backing vocals, [11] supporting Starr's lead vocal part. [47] Musical arranger Jack Nitzsche helped give the recording a sound typical of Phil Spector 's hit productions from the 1960s; photo by Brian Ashley White Jack Nitzsche , Phil Spector 's musical arranger for much of the 1960s, [48] [49] provided the song's string and choral arrangements, which were overdubbed at Burbank Studios on 29 June. [10] Aside from Nitzsche's contributions, the recording incorporates aspects of Spector's Wall of Sound production [50] through the use of multiple rhythm guitars and drums, and prominent percussion such as castanets . [51] Leng draws parallels between the \"resonant arrangement\" on \"Photograph\" and the production that Harrison adopted for Ravi Shankar 's song \" I Am Missing You \", [52] an April 1973 recording that also featured Starr. [53] \"Down and Out\" [ edit ] With \"Photograph\" selected as the album's lead single , Starr chose \"Down and Out\", a song written by him alone, for the B-side . [19] Starr recorded the song in England, backed by Harrison, pianist Gary Wright and Voormann. [54] The Harrison-produced session most likely took place in 1972, according to authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter, during the same period as Starr and Harrison's first attempt at recording \"Photograph\". [55] [nb 5] A twelve-bar blues with what Starr biographer Alan Clayson describes as \"perfunctory\" lyrics, the recording features solos from Harrison, on slide guitar , [19] and Wright. [55] Perry subsequently added a horn section, resulting in him being credited as co-producer on the track. [54] Carr and Tyler dismiss \"Down and Out\" with the description: \"a very mundane throwaway tune only saved from extinction by the professional arrangement and by Harrison's distinctive slide-guitar solo\". [23] Release [ edit ] Apple Records released \"Photograph\", backed by \"Down and Out\", on 24 September 1973 in America, and on 19 October in Britain. [59] [nb 6] Starr made a promotional film for \"Photograph\", in which he mimed to the song while walking through the grounds of Tittenhurst Park , [61] the Berkshire estate that he had recently purchased from former bandmate John Lennon . [62] To circumvent the BBC 's ban on lip-synching , Starr placed his hand over his mouth for part of the song, [10] thereby making it impossible to tell whether he was singing or merely miming. [61] [nb 7] The single's picture sleeve consisted of a photo by Barry Feinstein that showed Starr's head poking through a large star made of silver foil. [63] The same image, which author Bruce Spizer terms \"the Ringo starfish\", appeared on the single's face labels and on those of the Ringo album. [63] The album's release followed in November 1973, [64] with \"Photograph\" appearing as the third track, preceding another Harrison contribution, \" Sunshine Life for Me (Sail Away Raymond) \". [65] Opposite the printed lyrics for \"Photograph\" inside the album booklet, a lithograph by Voormann depicted a framed picture on a shelf or desktop, in which Starr looks dejectedly at a framed picture of a woman. [66] In his personal life at this point, the album's arrival coincided with the failure of Starr's marriage, partly as a result of Harrison and Maureen conducting an affair. [67] While the friendship between the two former bandmates soon recovered, [68] Starr and Harrison would not officially write another song together after \"Photograph\". [69] Noting the context in which Starr's song of \"beautiful sadness\" was released in the United States, Clayson describes \"Photograph\" as having been a popular request on radio playlists \"for a nation still awaiting the return of many of its sons from Vietnam , following the January cease-fire \". [19] Rodriguez comments on the precipitous timing of the single, which \"capitaliz[ed] on the year's nostalgia craze\", [24] while news of Starr recording with each of his former bandmates during the Ringo sessions provided further impetus. [16] In late November, the single topped America's Billboard Hot 100 for one week, [70] Starr's first number 1 hit on that chart as a solo artist [71] and Harrison's third there as a composer since the Beatles' break-up in 1970. [72] [73] \"Photograph\" was also number 1 in Canada and Australia, while in Britain it peaked at number 8. [74] In Rodriguez's words, the single \"did a good job of setting the table\" for Ringo , [24] which also enjoyed considerable commercial success. [16] [39] On 28 December 1973, \"Photograph\" was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America , [75] signifying US sales of 1 million [76] \u2013 Starr's second such award, after \"It Don't Come Easy\". [77] Reception [ edit ] On release, Ben Gerson of Rolling Stone highlighted \"Photograph\" as one of the album's \"three most wonderful songs\", along with the Lennon-composed \" I'm the Greatest \" and the Harrison\u2013 Mal Evans collaboration \" You and Me (Babe) \". [78] Gerson noted how the song's intro provided an effective \"pull on the listener\" and wrote that, while the lyrics had a sorrowful quality, \"the effect is warming\". [78] Billboard ' s album reviewer praised Perry's \"stunning production\" on \"the best Ringo album ever\", adding: \"We all know already that 'Photograph' has got to be a No. 1 single this month, right?\" [79] Although less impressed with Ringo , Alan Betrock wrote in Phonograph Record : \"It's also clear when you reach 'Photograph' that Side One is the undisputed champ of the album. Jack Nitzsche has thrown in a lot of his past influences here, including the Famous School of Phil Spector castanets, lesson No. 2.\" [80] Betrock concluded of the song: \"'Photograph' is one of those rare pop records that grows stronger with each play, and will be covered and revived for years to come (I'll lay you 50-1 it appears on the next Andy Williams album).\" [80] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic considers \"Photograph\" a \"gorgeous collaboration\" between Starr and Harrison, a track that \"ranks\u00a0... among the very best post-Beatles songs by any of the Fab Four\". [1] Robert Rodriguez describes it as \"an elegantly produced ballad\" and Starr's \"signature tune as a solo artist\". [81] Rodriguez continues: \"The ersatz Wall of Sound somehow managed not to swamp the lead vocal and Harrison harmony, while embodying the best qualities of the Beatles' singles: hummable and familiar, yet fresh and enduring.\" [82] In his 1977 book The Beatles Forever , Nicholas Schaffner wrote of how the song's \"grand, sweeping arrangement\" was reminiscent of Harrison's \"own recent cosmic productions\". [16] Author Elliot Huntley similarly acknowledges the extent of Harrison's influence on this and other tracks on Ringo while rueing that \"Photograph\" marks the only formal co-composition by the two ex-Beatles. [83] Huntley describes the song as the album's \"stand-out track\" and \"by a country mile, the commercial high-point\" for Starr as a songwriter. [20] Former Mojo editor Mat Snow recognises it as \"perhaps the single best song of [Starr's] career\" and the \"emotional heart\" of the album. [84] Re-releases and live versions [ edit ] The song provided the title to Starr's 2007 career-spanning compilation Photograph: The Very Best of Ringo Starr , [1] having earlier appeared on Blast from Your Past (1975), a greatest-hits collection covering his years on Apple Records. [85] For the 1991 CD reissue of Ringo , the album was expanded through the inclusion of three bonus tracks, [86] the last of which was the long-unavailable \"Down and Out\". [87] In 2009, \"Photograph\" was featured in the Judd Apatow -directed film Funny People [88] and appeared on the accompanying soundtrack album . [89] Starr performing with his All-Starr Band in 2011 Following his return to touring in July 1989 [90] \u2013 the first tour for Starr since the Beatles quit performing live in 1966 [91] \u2013 he has played \"Photograph\" regularly with the various incarnations of his All-Starr Band . Eschewing his drum kit for the role of lead singer, [92] Starr often closed his shows with the song (before returning for an encore ) during tours he made between 1989 and 2000. [93] A live version appeared on the album and video Ringo Starr and His All-Starr Band (1990); [94] recorded at the Greek Theatre , Los Angeles, on 3 September 1989, [95] it features the original All-Starr line-up of Starr, Billy Preston , Jim Keltner, Rick Danko , Levon Helm , Dr. John , Joe Walsh , Nils Lofgren and Clarence Clemons . [96] Starr also included the song in his performances on the television shows VH1 Storytellers , in May 1998, [97] and PBS 's Soundstage , in August 2005. [98] Featuring backing from the Roundheads \u2013 a band led by his latter-day producer Mark Hudson \u2013 these recordings were issued on Starr's releases VH1 Storytellers (1998) [99] and Ringo Starr: Live at Soundstage (2007), respectively. [98] Further versions with his All-Starr Band have appeared on the albums King Biscuit Flower Hour Presents Ringo & His New All-Starr Band (2002), [97] Ringo Starr & His All Starr Band Live 2006 (2008) [100] and Live at the Greek Theatre 2008 (2010), the latter with Gary Wright among the revised line-up. [101] Starr re-recorded the song with the American band Vandaveer for his 2017 album Give More Love . [102] Performance at the Concert for George [ edit ] On 29 November 2002, Starr performed \"Photograph\" at the Concert for George , [103] held at London's Royal Albert Hall to mark the first anniversary of Harrison's death. [104] According to the Concert for George website: \"Ringo Starr caught everyone with a tear in their eye with a rendition of 'Photograph', a composition he wrote with George, which seemed to sum up how everyone felt.\" [105] Starr's appearance came towards the end of the concert, and Inglis writes that his arrival was \"given an extra poignancy by his choice of song\". [106] In his preamble to the audience, Starr stated, \"I loved George, George loved me\", [107] before mentioning that \"Photograph\" had taken on a new meaning with the passing of Harrison. [106] This performance \u2013 with a large band that included Jeff Lynne , Eric Clapton , Dhani Harrison , Preston, Keltner and saxophonist Jim Horn \u2013 was issued on the Concert for George album (2003) [108] and appears in David Leland 's documentary film of the event . [109] [110] In a July 2003 interview, Starr discussed his recently released tribute song to Harrison, \" Never Without You \", while acknowledging that he remained closest to Harrison out of all the former Beatles following the band's break-up. [111] Performance at the 2014 Grammy Awards [ edit ] Starr sang \"Photograph\" at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards , [112] during which he and Paul McCartney , as the two surviving ex-Beatles, were honoured with the Recording Academy 's Lifetime Achievement Award . [113] The event took place at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on 26 January 2014. [114] Rolling Stone reported on Starr's performance of the song: \"Backed by a massive full band, he bounced around the stage while old black-and-white photographs showed on a big screen behind him.\" [115] The accompanying images were taken from Starr's recently published book; [112] also titled Photograph , it consists of photos from his personal collection, dating back to the 1950s and '60s. [116] Cover versions and references [ edit ] Engelbert Humperdinck and the Ray Conniff Singers each released recordings of the song in 1974. [117] The following year, London-based recording engineer David Hentschel covered \"Photograph\", along with all the other tracks on Ringo , [118] for his album Sta*rtling Music . [119] The latter, an experimental work featuring Hentschel on ARP synthesizer , [120] was the first release on Starr's short-lived record label, Ring O' Records . [121] A cover version of the song by American alt rock band Camper Van Beethoven appeared on their 1993 rarities compilation Camper Vantiquities . [122] Canadian band Sloan made mention of \"Photograph\" in their 1996 single \" The Lines You Amend \", the lyrics of which refer to a song \" ...\u00a0about photographs / Sung by Ringo Starr / Especially in the chorus part / You always said, 'Now don't you start'. \" [123] Cilla Black eventually recorded \"Photograph\", for her 2003 album Beginnings: Greatest Hits & New Songs \u2013 a version that \"she jumps into head first at her most soulful\", according to music critic Bruce Eder. [124] While Starr's original recording appeared on the soundtrack to Funny People , a cover by the film's leading actor, Adam Sandler , is available as an iTunes bonus track with the album.

[4] Jump up ^ Some sources claim that \"Photograph\" originated in Almeria, Spain, where Starr was filming Blindman , [10] [11] yet his role in that film was only confirmed at the end of the Cannes Film Festival. [12] According to entries in Keith Badman's book The Beatles Diary Volume 2 , Starr joined the production in Rome on 17 June before carrying out location filming in Almeria through July. [13] Jump up ^ Starr and Harrison both contributed to 1972 albums by Bobby Keys , Harry Nilsson and Lon & Derrek Van Eaton , [27] [28] in addition to participating in a session for a proposed Cilla Black single in August 1972. [29] Author Alan Clayson refers to Harrison and Starr as \"the Tweedledum and Tweedledee of such occasions\", due to their many sessions together during the early 1970s. [27] Jump up ^ Starr's previous solo albums, Sentimental Journey and Beaucoups of Blues (both 1970), had been forays focusing on pre-rock era standards and country music , respectively. [36] [37] Jump up ^ Alternatively, the line-up of Starr, Harrison, Wright and Voormann was the same as that on \"Back Off Boogaloo\", [56] recorded at Apple [57] in September 1971. [58] Jump up ^ The catalog numbers were Apple 1865 and Apple R 5992 in the US and the UK, respectively.

It was headlined by the British rock group Coldplay [1] with special guest performers Beyonc\u00e9 and Bruno Mars , who previously had headlined the Super Bowl XLVII and Super Bowl XLVIII halftime shows, respectively. Contents [ hide ] 1 Background 2 Performance 3 Critical reception 3.1 Controversy 4 Commercial reception 5 Set list 6 See also 7 References 8 External links Background [ edit ] Levi's Stadium , location of Super Bowl 50 and the halftime show Coldplay , Rihanna , and Katy Perry were considered as potential acts for the Super Bowl XLIX halftime show in 2015. [2] Perry was soon confirmed as the headliner of the halftime show in October 2014. In late November, 2015, reports surfaced stating that multiple acts would perform during the halftime show. Coldplay was confirmed as the lead half time performer for Super Bowl 50 on December 3, 2015, one day before the release of their seventh studio album A Head Full of Dreams . [1] It was confirmed that Beyonc\u00e9 and Bruno Mars would join Coldplay as special guests. [3] Chris Martin called Mars to ask him to perform with Coldplay; however, Mars declined the offer. Nevertheless, the singer of Coldplay invited Mars to his studio in Malibu where he was working. [4] There, Martin revealed to Mars that he wanted for him to perform \"Uptown Funk\" with Beyonce. Despite this, Mars still didn't think it was a good idea and asked the former to talk to Beyonce to see what was her opinion on that. Martin videotaped him and Mars, while the former sang a song to Beyonc\u00e9 so that she would come to do the Super Bowl with both of them. [4] [5] Beyonce response was receptive to the idea. [4] At that time, Mars and Beyonc\u00e9 were both doing a diet and stressing out. [4] One day before the performance they were \"watching playback backstage\", while Beyonce ate a bag of Cheetos. [4] Mars asked her \"That's what you're doing?\", to which she replied \"There's nothing more we can do these last two days. It's gonna be what it's gonna be. So I'm gonna enjoy this bag of Cheetos.\" [4] Mars strongly believes that Beyonc\u00e9 is \"coming for you every single time. So you better bring your A-game every time.\" [6] Performance [ edit ] Coldplay performing the halftime show. Coldplay frontman Chris Martin during the performance. Field during the halftime show. The audience participates in a card stunt The show opened with Chris Martin singing the opening chorus from \" Yellow \". He was then joined by the remaining band members of Coldplay to perform \" Viva la Vida \", \" Paradise \", and \" Adventure of a Lifetime \" with the Youth Orchestra Los Angeles conducted by Gustavo Dudamel and the University of California Marching Band . Bruno Mars, Mark Ronson , and a troupe of backing dancers (dressed in the style of Michael Jackson [7] ) then performed \" Uptown Funk \". Beyonc\u00e9, also in a Jackson-inspired outfit and appearing with a set of backing dancers dressed as Black Panthers , then performed her new single \" Formation \" in a mass choreographed dance number before joining Mars onstage for a verse of \"Uptown Funk\". Coldplay played a snippet of \" Clocks \" during a video montage of past Super Bowl halftime and national anthem performances, including those by Bruce Springsteen , Missy Elliott , Katy Perry , The Rolling Stones , Paul McCartney , Stevie Wonder , Diana Ross , James Brown , Whitney Houston , Michael Jackson , The Black Eyed Peas , U2 , Prince , Beyonc\u00e9 and Mars. The show concluded with the band performing \" Fix You \" and \"Up&Up\" with Beyonc\u00e9, Mars and everyone taking part in the show. At the end of the performance, the audience participated in a card-stunt creating a rainbow and the phrase, \"Believe in love\", the closing lyrics to Coldplay's A Head Full of Dreams . Critical reception [ edit ] Bruno Mars performed at the Super Bowl 50 halftime show and received positive reviews. The performance received generally mixed review from critics, who complimented Beyonc\u00e9 and Mars' part of the performance but were critical of Coldplay. Jon Caramanica of The New York Times stated that Coldplay \"acted more as a stagehand than an actual performer\" while Beyonc\u00e9's section of the performance was \"the night's true event\". Caramanica also noted that Beyonc\u00e9 and Mars \"outsang\" Martin during the closing part of the performance. [8] Andrew Barker of Variety similarly noted that \"Coldplay seemed resigned to politely allowing themselves to be played right off their own stage\" by the \"far flashier\" Mars and Beyonc\u00e9. [9] In a review for Fox Sports , Chris Chase panned Coldplay's performance, calling it \"inexplicable, indecipherable, and unnecessary\" and a \"musical snooze\". Chase complimented Beyonc\u00e9's and Mars' appearances but described the performance as \"boring\". [10] Alex Needham of The Guardian gave the performance four stars, saying that \"Queen Bey at the height of her powers effortlessly overwhelmed Coldplay's widescreen anthems in a show that seemed lightweight until she showed up\". [11] Beyonc\u00e9 , seen here performing at the show, was both praised and castigated for her performance. Robert Bianco of USA Today stated that Martin \"seemed overwhelmed\" by the size of the event, and that despite being a \"personable and energetic performer\", an \"awful lot\" of Martin's energy \"went into jumping\". Bianco praised Beyonc\u00e9's appearance and stated that she \"stole the show\". [12] Wendy Geller of Yahoo! also complimented Beyonc\u00e9's and Mars' appearances, but criticized the montage of previous halftime performances, describing it as \"confusing rather than touching\" and stating that the performance was \"definitely a cold play\". [13] Controversy [ edit ] Following the performance, Beyonc\u00e9 was criticized for performing a song that they considered to be \"anti-police\" during the halftime show and for appearing to align herself with the Black Lives Matter movement. Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani accused the performance of being anti-police and also criticized Beyonc\u00e9's use of Black Power and Black Panther Party symbolism in her dance routine. \"This is football , not Hollywood , and I thought it was really outrageous that she used it as a platform to attack police officers who are the people who protect her and protect us, and keep us alive,\" he said. [14] The controversy caused a \"#BoycottBeyonce\" hashtag on Twitter and protesters announced plans for an \"anti-Beyonc\u00e9\" rally on the morning of February 16 outside of the NFL's headquarters in New York City, but no one showed up for such a rally. [15] CNN political commentator Sally Kohn stated that \"too many police continue to show themselves to be far more interested in reactionary defensiveness and preserving the abusive status quo.\" [16] Black Lives Matter activist Melina Abdullah praised Beyonc\u00e9 and other artists who \"are willing to raise social consciousness and use their artistry to advance social justice.\" [17] [18] Commercial reception [ edit ] The halftime show became the fourth highest ever watched show in the United States, with total viewership of 115.5 million.

The single reached number one in the UK Singles Chart on 8 June 1967 and stayed there for six weeks. [3] Without much promotion, it reached number 5 on the Bilboard pop chart in the United States. [4] One of the anthems of the 1967 Summer of Love , it is one of fewer than 30 singles to have sold over 10 million copies worldwide. [5] With its Bach -derived instrumental melody, soulful vocals, and unusual lyrics \u2013 by the song's co-authors Gary Brooker , Keith Reid [6] and Matthew Fisher \u2013 \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" reached No. 1 in several countries when released in 1967. In the years since, it has become an enduring classic. It was the most played song in the last 75 years in public places in the UK (as of 2009), [7] and the United Kingdom performing rights group Phonographic Performance Limited in 2004 recognised it as the most-played record by British broadcasting of the past 70 years. [8] Also in 2004, Rolling Stone placed \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" 57th on its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time . In 1977, the song was named joint winner (along with Queen 's \" Bohemian Rhapsody \") of \"The Best British Pop Single 1952\u20131977\" at the Brit Awards . [9] In 1998 the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame . [10] More than 1000 recorded cover versions by other artists are known. [11] [12] [13] The song has been included in many music compilations over the decades and has also been used in the soundtracks of numerous films, including The Big Chill , Purple Haze , Breaking the Waves , The Boat That Rocked , Martin Scorsese 's segment of New York Stories , Stonewall , and Ken Burns and Lynn Novick 's documentary series The Vietnam War . Cover versions of the song have also been featured in many films, for example, by King Curtis in Withnail and I and by Annie Lennox in The Net . The original writing credits were for Brooker and Reid only. On 30 July 2009, Matthew Fisher won co-writing credit for the music in a unanimous ruling from the Law Lords . Contents [ hide ] 1 Recording and personnel 2 Lyrics 3 Composition 4 Release and reception 5 Promotional films 6 Authorship lawsuit 7 Chart performance 7.1 Weekly singles charts 7.2 Year-end charts 8 Annie Lennox version 8.1 Charts 9 References 10 Sources 11 External links Recording and personnel [ edit ] The song was performed and recorded at Olympic Sound Studios in London , England, with Gary Brooker providing the vocals and piano, Matthew Fisher on a Hammond M-102 organ, David Knights on bass and Ray Royer on guitar. Drums were by session drummer Bill Eyden . A few days later, the song was re-recorded with the band's then newly recruited drummer Bobby Harrison , but that version was discarded, and one of the original mono recordings was chosen for release. Producer for the record was Denny Cordell , and Keith Grant was the sound engineer. [14] The song was included on the US release of the Procol Harum album, in September 1967, but not on the later UK version. [15] Lyrics [ edit ] Reid got the title and starting point for the song at a party. He overheard someone at the party saying to a woman, \"You've turned a whiter shade of pale\", and the phrase stuck in his mind. [16] [17] The original lyrics had four verses, of which only two are heard on the original recording. The third verse has been heard in live performances by Procol Harum, and more seldom also the fourth. [18] The author of Procol Harum: Beyond the Pale , Claes Johansen, suggests that the song \"deals in metaphorical form with a male/female relationship which after some negotiation ends in a sexual act\". [17] This is supported by Tim de Lisle in Lives of the Great Songs , who remarks that the lyrics concern a drunken seduction, which is described through references to sex as a form of travel, usually nautical, using mythical and literary journeys. [19] Other observers have also commented that the lyrics concern a sexual relationship. [16] Contrary to the above interpretations, Reid was quoted in the February 2008 issue of Uncut magazine as saying: I was trying to conjure a mood as much as tell a straightforward, girl-leaves-boy story. With the ceiling flying away and room humming harder, I wanted to paint an image of a scene. I wasn\u2019t trying to be mysterious with those images, I was trying to be evocative. I suppose it seems like a decadent scene I\u2019m describing. But I was too young to have experienced any decadence, then. I might have been smoking when I conceived it, but not when I wrote. It was influenced by books, not drugs. Structurally and thematically, the song is unusual in many respects. While the recorded version is 4:03 long, it is composed of only two verses, each with chorus. The piece is also more instrument-driven than most songs of the period, and with a much looser rhyme scheme . Its unusually allusive and referential lyrics are much more complex than most lyrics of the time (for example, the chorus focuses on Chaucer 's \" The Miller's Tale \"). Thus, this piece can be considered an early example of progressive rock . [ citation needed ] The phrase a whiter shade of pale has since gained widespread use in the English language, noticed by several dictionaries. [20] [21] [22] As such, the phrase is today often used in contexts independent of any consideration of the song. [23] It has also been heavily paraphrased, in forms like \"an Xer shade of Y\", to the extent that it has been recognised as a snowclone [24] [25] \u2013 a type of clich\u00e9 and phrasal template . Composition [ edit ] The song's distinctive, Bach-inspired organ part was played on a Hammond M102 . The song is in moderate time in C major and is characterised by the bassline moving stepwise downwards in a repeated pattern throughout. In classical music this is known as a ground bass . The harmonic structure is identical for the organ melody, the verse and the chorus, except that the chorus finishes with a cadence . The main organ melody appears at the beginning and after each verse/chorus. But it is also heard throughout, playing variations of its theme and counterpointing the vocal line. As the chorus commences \"And so it was, that later ...\", the vocal and organ accompaniment begin a short crescendo , with the organist running his finger rapidly down and up the entire keyboard. The final instrumental fades out to silence \u2013 a common device in pop music of the time. Dutch author, and Bach aficionado, Maarten 't Hart calls \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" an \"original adaptation\" of Johann Sebastian Bach 's Ich steh mit einem Fu\u00df im Grabe, BWV 156 . Besides, the Hammond organ line of the song came from Bach's \" Sleepers, Wake! \" and \" Air on the G String \", both of which use a similar stepwise bass motion. The similarity is referred to in the 1982 play The Real Thing by Tom Stoppard and 1991 film The Commitments . A yet closer melodic influence that is seldom cited can arguably [ weasel\u00a0words ] be found in the organ choral prelude \"O Mensch bewein dein' S\u00fcnde gro\u00df\" (O Man, Lament Your Sin So Great), BWV 622, from Bach's Orgelb\u00fcchlein (Little Organ Book). The music also borrows ideas from \" When a Man Loves a Woman \" by Percy Sledge . [26] Release and reception [ edit ] The single was released on 12 May 1967 in the United Kingdom by Deram Records and entered Record Retailer ' s chart (later the UK Singles Chart ) on 25 May. In two weeks it reached number 1, where it stayed for six weeks. Writing in 2005, Jim Irvin of Mojo said that its arrival at number 1 on 8 June 1967, on the same day that the Beatles ' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band topped the national albums chart, marked the start of the Summer of Love in Britain. [27] According to music journalist and author Harvey Kubernik, in the context of the Summer of Love, \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" was the \"one song [that] stood above all others, its Everest-like status conferred by no less than John Lennon and Paul McCartney , who were enthralled by the Chaucerian wordplay and heavenly Baroque accompaniment\". [15] Kubernik also writes that, amid the search for higher consciousness during the flower power era, the song \"galvanised a congregation of disaffected youth dismissive of traditional religion but anxious to achieve spiritual salvation\". [28] In the United States, the single reached number 5 on the Billboard Hot 100 and sold over 1 million copies. It also peaked at number 22 on the soul charts there. [29] In the Netherlands, the song entered the chart at number 1 in June 1967 and again reached number 1 in July 1972. A May 1972 re-release on Fly Records stayed in the UK charts for a total of 12 weeks and peaked at number 13. \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" has continued to receive critical acclaim. Along with Queen 's \" Bohemian Rhapsody \", \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" was jointly recognised as \"The Best British Pop Single 1952\u20131977\" at the BRIT Awards , part of Elizabeth II 's Silver Jubilee . In 1998 the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame . In 2004, it appeared at number 57 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \" 500 Greatest Songs of All Time \". British TV station Channel 4 placed the song at number 19 in its chart of \"The 100 Greatest No. 1 Singles\". [30] Promotional films [ edit ] One of the clips for the song was filmed at Witley Court , part of which was gutted by fire in 1937. The first promotional clip for \"A Whiter Shade of Pale\" was shot in the ruins of Witley Court in Worcestershire, England. [31] It features four of the five musicians who played on the hit single: Gary Brooker, Matthew Fisher, David Knights and Ray Royer, in performance and walking through the ruins. Only the drummer in the video isn't on the record: early band member Bobby Harrison is seen miming to session man Bill Eyden's drumming. The film was directed by Peter Clifton , whose insertion of Vietnam War newsreel footage caused it to be banned from airplay on the BBC 's Top of the Pops TV show. [32] Procol Harum subsequently made a second promotional clip, using \" Scopitone \" technology. By this time, Robin Trower and B.J. Wilson had replaced Royer and Harrison in the band, so only three of the five musicians on the recording are represented. No performance footage appears in this film \u2013 only scenes of the five musicians cavorting around London and running across fields. The same lineup, with Fisher wearing a monk's cowl , mimed to the song on Top of the Pops , although Brooker sang live. Black-and-white footage of the performance has been shown online. The song represents 1967 in the 2004 release Top of the Pops 40th Anniversary 1964\u20132004 DVD . There was also a film shot as part of Joel Gallen 's Deja-View music video series. [33] Originally airing on various networks in late 1985 through 1986, this video starred Harry Dean Stanton and Bernie Taupin , but featured no member of the band. It has also aired on VH1 Classic , and has recently surfaced online. [34] [35] Authorship lawsuit [ edit ] In 2005, former Procol Harum organist Matthew Fisher filed suit in the High Court against Gary Brooker and his publisher, claiming that he co-wrote the music for the song. [36] Fisher won the case on 20 December 2006 but was awarded 40% of the composers' share of the music copyright, rather than the 50% he was seeking and was not granted royalties for the period before 2005. [37] Brooker and publisher Onward Music were granted leave to appeal, and a hearing on the matter was held before a panel of three judges during the week of 1 October 2007. The decision, on 4 April 2008, by Lord Justice Mummery , in the Court of Appeal upheld Fisher's co-authorship [38] but ruled that he should receive no royalties as he had taken too long (38 years) to bring his claim to litigation. Full royalty rights were returned to Brooker. [39] On 5 November 2008, Fisher was granted permission to appeal this decision to the House of Lords . [40] Lawyers say it is the first time the Law Lords have been asked to rule on a copyright dispute involving a song. [41] The appeal was heard in the House of Lords on 22\u201323 April 2009. [42] On 30 July 2009 the Law Lords unanimously ruled in Fisher's favour. They noted that the delay in bringing the case had not caused any harm to the other party; on the contrary he had benefited financially from it. They also pointed out that there were no time limits to copyright claims under English law. The right to future royalties was therefore returned to Fisher. [43] [44] The musicological basis of the judgment, and its effect on the rights of musicians who contribute composition to future works, has drawn some attention in the music world.

{"question": "where is most distortion found on a globe", "answer": "", "context": "Globe - Wikipedia Globe From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search This article is about spherical models of the Earth or other celestial bodies. For other uses, see Globe (disambiguation) . A globe is a spherical model of Earth , of some other celestial body , or of the celestial sphere . Globes serve similar purposes to maps , but unlike maps, do not distort the surface that they portray except to scale it down. A globe of Earth is called a terrestrial globe . A globe of the celestial sphere is called a celestial globe . A globe shows details of its subject. A terrestrial globe shows land masses and water bodies. It might show nations and prominent cities and the network of latitude and longitude lines. Some have raised relief to show mountains. A celestial globe shows stars, and may also show positions of other prominent astronomical objects. Typically it will also divide the celestial sphere up into constellations. The word \"globe\" comes from the Latin word globus , meaning \" sphere \". Globes have a long history. The first known mention of a globe is from Strabo , describing the Globe of Crates from about 150\u00a0BC. The oldest surviving terrestrial globe is the Erdapfel , wrought by Martin Behaim in 1492. The oldest surviving celestial globe sits atop the Farnese Atlas , carved in the 2nd century Roman Empire . Contents [ hide ] 1 Terrestrial and planetary 2 Celestial 3 History 4 Manufacture 5 Notable examples 6 Gallery 7 See also 8 References 9 External links Terrestrial and planetary [ edit ] Flat maps are created using a map projection that inevitably introduces an increasing amount of distortion the larger the area that the map shows. A globe is the only representation of the Earth that does not distort either the shape or the size of large features\u00a0\u2013 land masses, bodies of water, etc. The circumference of the Earth is quite close to 40\u00a0million metres. [1] [2] Many globes are made with a circumference of one metre, so they are models of the Earth at a scale of 1:40\u00a0million. In imperial units, many globes are made with a diameter of one foot , yielding a circumference of 3.14 feet and a scale of 1:41,777,000. Globes are also made in many other sizes. Sometimes a globe has surface texture showing topography ; in these, elevations are exaggerated, otherwise they would be hardly visible. Most modern globes are also imprinted with parallels and meridians , so that one can tell the approximate coordinates of a specific place. Globes may also show the boundaries of countries and their names, a feature that can quickly become out of date, as countries change their name or borders. Many terrestrial globes have one celestial feature marked on them: a diagram called the analemma , which shows the apparent motion of the Sun in the sky during a year. Globes generally show north at the top, but many globes allow the axis to be swiveled so that southern portions can be viewed conveniently. This capability also permits exploring the earth from different orientations to help counter the north-up bias caused by conventional map presentation. Celestial [ edit ] Celestial globe made by Coronelli for Louis XIV c.1683 See also: Celestial globe Celestial globes show the apparent positions of the stars in the sky. They omit the Sun , Moon and planets because the positions of these bodies vary relative to those of the stars, but the ecliptic , along which the Sun moves, is indicated. History [ edit ] The \"Erdapfel\" of Martin Beheim is the oldest surviving terrestrial globe, made between 1491 and 1493; the Americas are not yet included. Germanisches Nationalmuseum , Nuremberg (2006) The sphericity of the Earth was established by Greek astronomy in the 3rd century BC, and the earliest terrestrial globe appeared from that period. The earliest known example is the one constructed by Crates of Mallus in Cilicia (now \u00c7ukurova in modern-day Turkey), in the mid-2nd century BC. No terrestrial globes from Antiquity or the Middle Ages have survived. An example of a surviving celestial globe is part of a Hellenistic sculpture, called the Farnese Atlas , surviving in a 2nd-century AD Roman copy in the Naples Archaeological Museum , Italy. [3] Early terrestrial globes depicting the entirety of the Old World were constructed in the Islamic world . [4] [5] According to David Woodward, one such example was the terrestrial globe introduced to Beijing by the Persian astronomer, Jamal ad-Din , in 1267. [6] The earliest extant terrestrial globe was made in 1492 by Martin Behaim (1459\u20131537) with help from the painter Georg Glockendon. [3] Behaim was a German mapmaker, navigator, and merchant. Working in Nuremberg , Germany, he called his globe the \"N\u00fcrnberg Terrestrial Globe.\" It is now known as the Erdapfel . Before constructing the globe, Behaim had traveled extensively. He sojourned in Lisbon from 1480, developing commercial interests and mingling with explorers and scientists. In 1485\u20131486, he sailed with Portuguese explorer Diogo C\u00e3o to the coast of West Africa. He began to construct his globe after his return to N\u00fcrnberg in 1490. Another early globe, the Hunt\u2013Lenox Globe , ca. 1510, is thought to be the source of the phrase Hic Sunt Dracones , or \u201c Here be dragons \u201d. A similar grapefruit -sized globe made from two halves of an ostrich egg was found in 2012 and is believed to date from 1504. It may be the oldest globe to show the New World . Stefaan Missine, who analyzed the globe for the Washington Map Society journal Portolan , said it was \u201cpart of an important European collection for decades.\u201d [7] After a year of research in which he consulted many experts, Missine concluded the Hunt\u2013Lenox Globe was a copper cast of the egg globe. [7] A facsimile globe showing America was made by Martin Waldseemueller in 1507. Another \u201cremarkably modern-looking\u201d terrestrial globe of the Earth was constructed by Taqi al-Din at the Istanbul observatory of Taqi al-Din during the 1570s. [8] The world\u2019s first seamless celestial globe was built by Mughal scientists under the patronage of Jahangir . [9] Globus IMP , electro-mechanical devices including five-inch globes have been used in Soviet and Russian spacecraft from 1961 to 2002 as navigation instruments. In 2001, the TMA version of the Soyuz spacecraft replaced this instrument with a virtual globe . [10] In the 1800s small pocket globes (less than 3 inches) were status symbols for gentlemen and educational toys for rich children. [11] Manufacture [ edit ] Play media A short, 1955 Dutch film showing the traditional manufacture of globes using paper gores Traditionally, globes were manufactured by gluing a printed paper map onto a sphere, often made from wood. The most common type has long, thin gores (strips) of paper that narrow to a point at the poles, [12] small disks cover over the inevitable irregularities at these points. The more gores there are, the less stretching and crumpling is required to make the paper map fit the sphere. Modern globes are often made from thermoplastic . Flat, plastic disks are printed with a distorted map of one of the Earth's Hemispheres . This is placed in a machine which molds the disk into a hemispherical shape. The hemisphere is united with its opposite counterpart to form a complete globe. Usually a globe is mounted so that its spin axis is 23.5\u00b0 from vertical, which is the angle the Earth's spin axis deviates from perpendicular to the plane of its orbit. This mounting makes it easy to visualize how seasons change. Notable examples [ edit ] A terrestrial globe on which the tracts and discoveries are laid down from the accurate observations made by Capts Cook, Furneux, Phipps, published 1782 / globe by John Newton\u00a0; cartography by William Palmer, held by the State Library of New South Wales The Unisphere in Flushing Meadows , New York , at the Billie Jean King USTA Tennis Center, at 120 feet (36.6\u00a0m) in diameter, is the world\u2019s largest geographical globe. (There are larger spherical structures, such as the Cinesphere in Toronto, Ontario , Canada , but this does not have geographical or astronomical markings.) Eartha , currently the world\u2019s largest rotating globe (41\u00a0ft or 12\u00a0m in diameter), at the DeLorme headquarters in Yarmouth, Maine The Mapparium , three-story, stained glass globe at the Mary Baker Eddy Library in Boston, which visitors walk through via a 30-foot (9.1\u00a0m) glass bridge. The Babson globe in Wellesley, Massachusetts , a 26-foot-diameter (7.9\u00a0m) globe which originally rotated on its axis and on its base to simulate day and night and the seasons The giant globe in the lobby of The News Building in New York City. The Hitler Globe, also known as the F\u00fchrer globe, was formally named the Columbus Globe for State and Industry Leaders . Two editions existed during Hitler\u2019s lifetime, created during the mid-1930s on his orders. (The second edition changed the name of Abyssinia to Italian East Africa). These globes were \u201cenormous\u201d and very costly. According to the New York Times , \u201cthe real Columbus globe was nearly the size of a Volkswagen and, at the time, more expensive.\u201d Several still exist, including three in Berlin: one at a geographical institute, one at the M\u00e4rkisches Museum , and another at the Deutsches Historisches Museum . The latter has a Soviet bullet hole through Germany. One of the two in public collections in Munich has an American bullet hole through Germany. There are several in private hands inside and out of Germany. A much smaller version of Hitler\u2019s globe was mocked by Charlie Chaplin in The Great Dictator , a film released in 1940.

After physical exams at school, at which Mikoto is ranked a Level-5 esper, Kuroko invites her colleague Kazari Uiharu to meet Mikoto, and Kazari decides to brings along her friend and classmate, Ruiko Saten , as well. As the four go to a cr\u00eaperie , where Kazari and Ruiko are surprised to find Mikoto nothing like the snobby socialite image that they had in mind, a bank robbery takes place nearby. Kuroko uses her teleportation ability to apprehend two robbers, but a third robber attempts to kidnap a wandering kid, hurting Ruiko when she attempts to stop him. This angers Mikoto, who uses her electromagnetic powers to fire her signature railgun attack at the robber and stop his escape. With the robbers apprehended by the Anti-Skills, the city's police and security, Ruiko is thanked by everyone for her brave rescue. 2 \"When Working Under a Hot Sun, Rehydration is Essential\" \"Entenka no Sagy\u014d ni wa Suibun Hoky\u016b ga Hissu desu no yo\" (\u708e\u5929\u4e0b\u306e\u4f5c\u696d\u306b\u306f\u6c34\u5206\u88dc\u7d66\u304c\u5fc5\u9808\u3067\u3059\u306e\u3088) October 9, 2009 Mikoto invites Kazari and Ruiko over to her dorm room to hang out, ruining Kuroko's plans of celebrating her one-month anniversary as Mikoto's roommate. Upon learning that Kuroko had ordered aphrodisiacs for the occasion, Mikoto ends up fighting her in the hallway, only for both of them to be caught using their power by the fearsome Tokiwadai Dorm Supervisor . As punishment, both are sent to clean the school pool, where Mikoto is introduced to Kuroko's classmates, Kinuho Wannai and Maaya Awatsuki . When Kinuho offers to help Mikoto clean the pool with her aquakinetic powers as thanks for rescuing her from some thugs a while back, Kuroko gets jealous of how well Mikoto gets on with others, believing that Mikoto has no use for her. To cheer her up, Mikoto gives Kuroko a present celebrating a slightly different anniversary, being the day when they became friends. However, whilst toasting, Kuroko accidentally drinks the aphrodisiac she had intended to give to Mikoto, becoming so overcome with lust that she steals Mikoto's underwear while she is still wearing them, prompting an electrical punishment. 3 \"Tokiwadai is Targeted\" \"Nerawareta Tokiwadai\" (\u306d\u3089\u308f\u308c\u305f\u5e38\u78d0\u53f0) October 16, 2009 Kazari and Ruiko are invited by Mikoto and Kuroko to visit the School Garden, a private district of Academy City where a large number of elite girls' schools are located. On the way, Ruiko ends up getting her uniform wet and has to borrow a Tokiwadai uniform. Whilst visiting a cake shop, Kuroko and Kazari are called back to Judgment and are informed of a case where several Tokiwadai students have been tased and had exaggerated eyebrows drawn on with permanent marker. Due to the uniform Ruiko is mistaken for a Tokiwadai student and is attacked in the shop's bathroom, becoming the latest victim. Kuroko and Uiharu narrow down the suspects to a Level-2 esper named Miho J\u016bfuku , who can turn herself invisible to the naked eye. After Ruiko confirms this, having seen Miho's reflection in the bathroom mirror, the girls use the garden's camera system to track down and corner Miho. She reveals that her boyfriend dumped her in favor of a Tokiwadai student because of her weird eyebrows, which led her to target other Tokiwadai students. Sympathetically, Ruiko forgives Miho and compliments her eyebrows, making her happy. As Miho is taken into custody, Mikoto wonders how a Level-2 esper managed to get so powerful. 4 \"Urban Legends\" \"Toshi Densetsu\" (\u90fd\u5e02\u4f1d\u8aac) October 23, 2009 Mikoto and the others discuss urban legends they have seen on the internet, including one about a mysterious woman who undresses in public. Of particular interest to Mikoto is one rumor concerning a boy with the ability to cancel out other abilities, reminding her of when she first met T\u014dma Kamij\u014d during an encounter with a group of thugs. While in town, Mikoto runs into T\u014dma as he tries to help a woman look for where she parked her car. When the woman suddenly starts undressing herself, T\u014dma runs away from the misunderstanding bystanders, leaving Mikoto to help the woman find her car, where they have some curious conversations. Later that day, Mikoto runs into T\u014dma again and gets him to agree to a fight near a riverbank. Despite Mikoto's creative use of her powers, she is unable to stop T\u014dma's ability to negate her attacks. T\u014dma pretends to lose after seeing Mikoto flinching, but this only serves to agitate her even more as she proceeds to chase him all night. 5 \"A Certain Pair of New Trainees\" \"Toaru Futari no Shinjin Kensh\u016b\" (\u3068\u3042\u308b\u4e8c\u4eba\u306e\u65b0\u4eba\u7814\u4fee) October 30, 2009 Whilst out on patrol, Kuroko and Kazari come across a couple of petty thieves stealing from a car in broad daylight. However, when Kuroko charges in, the thieves ambush her and injure Kazari as they make a quick getaway. Kazari scolds Kuroko for not only ignoring her warning, but also forgetting the promise they made together. Later that day, Mikoto is told the story about how Kuroko and Kazari first met in Judgment a few years ago. When Kuroko and her senior, Mii Konori , had gotten involved in a bank robbery, Kuroko's rash actions had led to Kazari being taken hostage by one of the robbers, an esper who can throw balls at a constant speed, and had caused Konori to become injured protecting her from one of his attacks. Having realized her mistakes, Kuroko had managed to teleport Kazari outside to safety, staying behind to face the robber. In the end, Kuroko had been saved thanks to Mikoto, who anonymously answered Kazari's pleas for help, and had managed to apprehend the robber. Through telling the story, Kuroko remembers the promise she made with Kazari was to be true to themselves and become full-fledged members of Judgment together. Realizing her folly, Kuroko catches up to Kazari and joins her in pursuing the car thieves. 6 \"Everyone is Proactive When It Comes to This\" \"K\u014d Iu Koto ni wa Minna Sekkyokuteki Nan desu yo\" (\u3053\u3046\u3044\u3046\u3053\u3068\u306b\u306f\u307f\u3093\u306a\u7a4d\u6975\u7684\u306a\u3093\u3067\u3059\u3088) November 6, 2009 When an esper starts using gravitons to cause aluminum metals hidden inside stuffed animals to explode all over the city, Judgment struggles to identify the culprit as the only esper whose ability is known to match the necessary level of the incidents is in a coma. Kuroko warns Mikoto not to do anything drastic like track down the culprit herself, but after Kazari leaves her Judgment armband behind, Mikoto uses the chance of being mistaken for a member of Judgment by Konori to show Kuroko that she too has what it takes to be in Judgment. However, she finds that being a Judgment member is not the exciting job she thought it was when she ends up doing a lot of menial, difficult tasks. When the pair are tasked to find a little girl's bag, Mikoto, assuming it is related to the graviton bomb case, takes drastic measures to retrieve the bag from a dog, only to discover no bomb was involved at all. Despite having her real identity exposed by Kuroko and Kazari, she is nevertheless thanked for her help, and by the end of the day, Mikoto has a new appreciation for a Judgment member's work. The next day, however, a Judgment member is injured protecting a civilian from a graviton explosion. 7 \"Abilities and Powers\" \"N\u014dryoku to Chikara\" (\u80fd\u529b\u3068\u3061\u304b\u3089) November 13, 2009 As Judgment and the Anti-Skills join forces to find the culprit behind the increasingly severe graviton bombings, Ruiko talks to Mikoto about the Level Upper, a rumored object said to increase an esper's level. The next day, Mikoto accompanies Ruiko and Kazari to the mall, where she runs into T\u014dma with the little girl whose bag she recovered the other day. After noticing a connection tying the graviton incidents, Kuroko and Konori realize that the culprit is targeting Judgment members, with Kazari set to be the next target. After an evacuation is mandated, Kazari, Mikoto, T\u014dma, and the young girl are left in the store with a graviton bomb hidden inside a stuffed animal. Mikoto fumbles her railgun trying to stop it, but everyone is saved by T\u014dma's right hand. Mikoto manages to find the culprit, Hatsuya Kaitabi, who wanted to punish Judgment for not protecting him from bullies, believing people with power like her and Judgment are corrupt. Mikoto punches him for using that as an excuse to hurt others, with Kuroko later telling him Mikoto would have still stood up to him even if she remained a Level-1 esper. The next day, Mikoto once again runs into T\u014dma, who explains why he did not seek recognition for rescuing everyone, only serving to aggravate Mikoto further. 8 \"Level Upper\" \"Reberu App\u0101\" (\u5e7b\u60f3\u5fa1\u624b\uff08\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb\u30a2\u30c3\u30d1\u30fc\uff09) November 20, 2009 After Mikoto and the others visit an ill Kazari, Kuroko becomes curious as to how Level-2 esper Hatsuya had powers equivalent to those of a Level-4 esper. When Mikoto brings up the Level Upper urban legend Ruiko had mentioned before, Kuroko points out this is not the first time an esper's power and recorded level have been vastly different. Mikoto goes to a restaurant and pretends to be an interested customer to a group of male delinquents who may have relevant information. Mikoto eventually gives up the act when they refuse to tell her, soon facing their leader, a girl named Elder Sister with the ability to manipulate the viscosity of asphalt . Mikoto wins the fight, though she does end up damaging a nearby generator in the process, causing a citywide blackout. The next day, Kuroko and Mikoto discover that Hatsuya, along with several other espers who had shown abnormally strong powers, have all fallen into comas. Meanwhile, Ruiko comes across a hidden link whilst browsing the internet on her music player, discovering a download for the Level Upper. 9 \"Majority Report\" \"Majoriti Rip\u014dto\" (\u30de\u30b8\u30e7\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3\u30fb\u30ea\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8) November 27, 2009 Mikoto and the others meet with AIM specialist Harumi Kiyama , the immodest woman Mikoto had previously met, about the Level Upper. Ruiko, who had downloaded the Level Upper, keeps it to herself when Kuroko mentions its relation to criminal activities. Noticing Ruiko feeling down about being a Level-0 esper, Mikoto tries to assure her that an esper's level is not important, though this secretly irritates Ruiko further. The next day, Ruiko stumbles upon a boy being conned by a group of thugs over Level Upper and, unable to just run away, decides to confront them. Coincidentally, Kuruko arrives before Ruiko gets hurt and subdues two of the thugs, but she has trouble using her teleportation powers against their boss, Trick, due to his light-distortion ability which affects her calculations. Trick chases Kuroko through an abandoned building, till Kuroko is able to teleport the building's windows directly into its supports, cutting right through them and causing the building to collapse. Having barely survived, Trick surrenders his Level Upper, which is revealed to be a music file. Meanwhile, as Ruiko feels even more conflicted about what to do with the Level Upper, she is approached by some of her classmates and, upon hearing that they are also interested in the Level Upper, decides to share it with them. 10 \"Silent Majority\" \"Sairento Majoriti\" (\u30b5\u30a4\u30ec\u30f3\u30c8\u30fb\u30de\u30b8\u30e7\u30ea\u30c6\u30a3) December 04, 2009 Ruiko uses the Level Upper on herself and her friends, becoming happy just to have an ability of her own. Meanwhile, Kuroko takes care of more Level Upper offenders and gains more injuries in the process, keeping them a secret from Mikoto. Remembering when they ate shaved ice the other day, Mikoto and Kuroko come to the conclusion that the Level Upper is using synesthesia to manipulate multiple senses via a single stimulus. Kazari hears from Ruiko that her friends had suddenly fallen unconscious due to the Level Upper, later arriving at Ruiko's apartment to find her unconscious as well. After Ruiko is admitted into hospital, Mikoto, believing she hurt Ruiko's feelings by saying an esper's level does not matter, asks to cooperate with Judgment in finding the culprit. After learning from the frog-faced doctor, Heaven Canceller , that the Level Upper victims seem to share a brainwave pattern with someone, Mikoto and the others discover the culprit is Kiyama, who had been using the Level Upper to connect the thoughts of espers like a parallel computing network. Kazari, who had visited Kiyama earlier and discovered her notes on synesthesia, is taken hostage by her. Noticing Kuroko's injuries, Mikoto goes by herself to rescue Kazari and stop Kiyama. 11 \"Dr. Kiyama\" \"Kiyama-Sensei\" (\u6728\u5c71\u305b\u3093\u305b\u3044) December 11, 2009 Kiyama explains that she used the Level Upper Network to connect many brains as an alternative supercomputer since she was not allowed to use the Tree Diagram supercomputer. She assures Kazari that the victims will be released soon and gives her a cure program. When she is roadblocked by the Anti-Skills, she harnesses the power of the Level Upper Network, called Multi-Skill, to utilize the various abilities of the victims to defeat them. Mikoto arrives and battles Kiyama, who blocks her every attack until she lets her guard down, during which Mikoto gets close enough to shock her directly. In the process, Mikoto experiences flashes of Kiyama\u2019s past, in which Kiyama had been assigned by her boss, Gensei Kihara , to be a teacher to a group of orphaned children, known as Child Errors, to prepare them for an experiment, growing fond of them in the process. However, the experiment had gone horribly wrong and the children had ended up in comas or worse, and Gensei choose to cover it up in the interests of science. Kiyama explains that she wanted to find a cure to save her students by using Tree Diagram but was denied every time, which led to her creating the Level Upper Network. As Kiyama's anger suddenly causes her to lose control of the network and fall unconscious, a strange fetus-like creature emerges from her head. 12 \"AIM Burst\" \"AIM B\u0101suto\" (AIM \u30d0\u30fc\u30b9\u30c8) December 18, 2009 Mikoto attempts to fight the creature as it heads towards a nuclear power plant, but finds her attacks only cause it to regenerate and to grow larger. With the network out of control, the comatose Level Upper users start screaming in pain. Kiyama explains how the creature, called AIM Burst, is the result of the 10,000 Level Upper users' AIM fields and their negative thoughts. With the help of Anti-Skill members Aiho Yomikawa and Tsuzuri Tess\u014d , Kazari manages to upload the cure Kiyama gave her, a song file, which is played all over the city, calming the Level Upper users and weakening AIM Burst. Despite losing its regenerative ability, AIM Burst is still able to use the abilities of the Level Upper victims, emitting their negative thoughts to Mikoto and Kiyama. Mikoto apologizes to the victims for not understanding their feelings, telling them not to give up on their dreams, and shoots a railgun to defeat AIM Burst by destroying its core. Kiyama is taking into custody by the Anti-Skills, still hoping to find a way to cure her students and challenging Mikoto to stop her again if she does not agree with her methods. Kazari rushes over to Ruiko, who, having recovered from her coma and lost her powers, apologizes to her for forgetting what was truly important. 13 \"A Bikini Divides the Eyeline Between Top and Bottom, but a One-Piece Shows Off the Figure so They Only Flatter the Slender\" \"Bikini wa Mesen ga J\u014dge ni Wakaremasu kedo Wanp\u012bsu wa Karada no Rain ga Demasu kara Hosoi Kata Shika Niawanain desu yo\" (\u30d3\u30ad\u30cb\u306f\u76ee\u7dda\u304c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u306b\u5206\u304b\u308c\u307e\u3059\u3051\u3069\u30ef\u30f3\u30d4\u30fc\u30b9\u306f\u8eab\u4f53\u306e\u30e9\u30a4\u30f3\u304c\u51fa\u307e\u3059\u304b\u3089\u7d30\u3044\u65b9\u3057\u304b\u4f3c\u5408\u308f\u306a\u3044\u3093\u3067\u3059\u3088) December 25, 2009 Kinuho and Maaya ask Mikoto and Kuroko to help them be models for an online swimsuit catalog, also inviting Kazari, Ruiko, Konori and Kuroko's rival, Mitsuko Kong\u014d . After choosing their swimsuits, the girls begin their shoot in a holographic studio that can replicate various environments down to the touch. The shoot goes well at first but the hologram system malfunctions, causing the environment to switch into weird settings, including a blizzard, a desert, a hurricane, and even the moon (with a homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey ). While the camera is repaired, the girls make some curry for lunch, with Mitsuko opting to make her own curry though she has no cooking experience. After having trouble, Mitsuko finally admits it to Kinuho and Maaya who ask Konori for help, and both teams produce good curry for a photo op. After the others go home, Mikoto stays behind to try a frilly swimsuit, her first choice though the others made her feel ashamed because of its childish style, and unwittingly broadcasts her antics to the company's public billboard, which T\u014dma observes in passing by. 14 \"Special Workshop\" \"Tokubetsu K\u014dsh\u016b\" (\u7279\u5225\u8b1b\u7fd2) January 8, 2010 [4] Ruiko, along with other students who had used the Level Upper, must attend a special class at a certain high school. Their first lesson, taught by the petite teacher Komoe Tsukuyomi , is about the importance of having a personal reality for ability development. During lunch, Ruiko once again encounters Miho, with whom she had been exchanging letters since their incident. Later, for their PE segment, Yomikawa has the class continuously run laps as an example of how one can surpass one's own limits. Elder Sister, the female gangster whom Mikoto fought before, complains that the classes are simply a form of punishment for using Level Upper, but Ruiko stands up to her, telling her they all deserved what they got for cheating. In their next class, Komoe explains that the special classes are not intended to be punishment, but rather lessons designed to motivate the students to try to surpass their limits and to regain the powers they once had. Komoe's speech impresses the class, including Ruiko, who remembers the kind words and advice her friends gave her and is encouraged to keep trying. After receiving a letter from Miho, who wants to follow her example, Ruiko reunites with Mikoto, Kuroko and Kazari. 15 \"Skill Out\" \"Sukiru Auto\" (\u30b9\u30ad\u30eb\u30a2\u30a6\u30c8) January 15, 2010 Mitsuko finds herself attacked by a Skill-Out gang called the Big Spiders, but is saved by a long-haired man with a spider tattoo, the description of whom Konori seems to recognize. This incident is shown to be the latest in a string of indiscriminate attacks on espers by the Big Spiders, led by one calling himself Wataru Kurozuma . Whilst investigating the gang's home turf in Academy City's 10th District, Mikoto and Kuroko come across the long-haired man who becomes their guide to the district. Mikoto and Kuroko head to the Big Spiders' hideout, but run into trouble when the gang use a sound system device called Capacity Down, which disrupts their esper abilities. The device is disabled by the long-haired man from before, who recognizes Big Spider's leader as Hebitani Tsuguo and claims himself to be the real Kurozuma. After Kurozuma singlehandedly defeats the gang, he is approached by Konori, who is revealed to be an old acquaintance of his. 16 \"Academy City\" \"Gakuen Toshi\" (\u5b66\u5712\u90fd\u5e02) January 22, 2010 While Konori avoids coming to work following her encounter with Kurozuma, Mikoto and the others meet up with Konori's roommate, Aomi Yanagisako. Aomi reveals that Konori was once a member of the Big Spiders, which was a friendlier group back then and, despite being an esper, she was allowed to stay by Kurozuma, with whom she fell in love. When Mikoto receives word that the Anti-Skills will be leading a surprise crackdown against the Skill-Out gangs the next day, she confronts Konori to ask why she will not leave the past behind. Konori explains that she left the gang when Kurozuma supposedly died during a fire; she later became a member of Judgment. Kurozuma explains to Konori how he was hospitalized after the fire, while she tries to convince him not to try to end the Big Spiders all by himself. Later, Mikoto has an epiphany and finally understands Konori's reasons. As the crackdown begins, Mikoto, Kuroko and Konori help Kurozuma fight the Big Spiders and destroy their weapons, including Capacity Down. With his gang members incapacitated, Hebitani threatens to light a bomb strapped on his chest, but he is knocked out by Kurozuma. As the Big Spiders are arrested by the Anti-Skills, Kurozuma asks Konori to arrest him as well, rekindling her trust and their friendship. 17 \"Tsuzuri's Summer Vacation\" \"Natsuyasumi no Tsuzuri\" (\u590f\u4f11\u307f\u306e\u3064\u3065\u308a) January 29, 2010 After having a bad day, Tsuzuri does a curfew run at an arcade where she meets a boy named Haruki K\u014dnoe, one of Kazari and Ruiko's classmates. As Tsuzuri's Anti-Skill duties get worse, Yomikawa gives her a day off to finish her teacher work. Later that day, she encounters K\u014dnoe at the arcade and teaches him how to get a secret character in her favorite beat 'em up game, \"Gekisho 9\". While carrying a drunken Yomikawa home, Komoe gives Tsuzuri a speech about the joys of helping others, inspiring her to do better the next day. After dealing with a mischievous nun , a burger-loving miko and a girl with a missing pendant , Tsuzuri returns to the arcade, where she ends up playing against K\u014dnoe on Gekisho 9, both using the secret character. As the two walk home, K\u014dnoe becomes interested when Tsuzuri brings up the idea of another Gekisho sequel, giving his thanks to her when they part ways. Sometime afterward, Tsuzuri learns that K\u014dnoe has transferred to a game-design school, sponsored by Gekisho's creators, which makes her happy to know she inspired him and strengthens her resolve to do better herself. 18 \"Asunaro Park\" \"Asunaroen\" (\u3042\u3059\u306a\u308d\u5712) February 5, 2010 After suffering the wrath of the Dorm Supervisor yet again, Kuroko seeks revenge and takes Mikoto with her to follow the Dorm Supervisor on her day off. They eventually arrive at an orphanage for Child Errors in Asunaro Park where, to their surprise, the Dorm Supervisor shows a kinder side to the children there. After spotting Kazari and Ruiko, who are helping out with their teacher Daigo, the girls realize that the Dorm Supervisor is in love with Daigo. Hoping it will change her attitude at the dorms, Kuroko offers to help her get the two of them together. The next day, the girls help mind the children while the Dorm Supervisor and Daigo make a birthday cake for one of the orphans, which fails due to her nervousness. During the party, the Dorm Supervisor protects one of the children when an earthquake kicks in, receiving praise from Daigo. The two later meet for dinner, where Daigo asks if there is anything wrong with a younger man marrying an older woman, which the girls interpret as a potential marriage proposal. However Daigo is actually planning to propose to Kazuko Shigenomori, the caretaker of the orphanage. Deciding to remain friends with Daigo and to give him her blessing, the Dorm Supervisor soon returns to her normal disciplinarian self. 19 \"Midsummer Festival\" \"Seikasai\" (\u76db\u590f\u796d) February 12, 2010 The Tokiwadai Middle School dormitory hosts the Midsummer Festival, an invitation-only event with most of the students dressed as maids. As Kuroko gets dragged by Maika Tsuchimikado to help in the kitchen, Mikoto gives a tour of the festival to Ruiko and Kazari, the latter of whom is very excited to experience the life of a Tokiwadai student. Mikoto, however, grows anxious as news of her upcoming stage performance spreads and raises expectations. As she nervously prepares for her stage debut, Mikoto meets T\u014dma backstage and, believing he was simply there to make fun of her, chases him away. In the process, she manages to force out all of her worries and performs a beautiful violin solo to the crowd. 20 \"Poltergeist\" \"Porut\u0101gaisuto\" (\u4e71\u96d1\u958b\u653e\uff08\u30dd\u30eb\u30bf\u30fc\u30ac\u30a4\u30b9\u30c8\uff09) February 19, 2010 Kazari gets a new roommate, a transfer student named Erii Haruue . Mikoto and Ruiko take Erii out to show her around while Kazari, Kuroko and Konori attend a meeting held by Therestina Kihara Lifeline of the Multi Active Rescue (MAR), concerning earthquake-like \" Poltergeist incidents\" caused by multiple espers simultaneously losing control of their abilities. That night, Mikoto and Kuroko skip out on their curfew to celebrate Erii's arrival with Ruiko and Konori at the local fireworks festival. Erii starts to reminisce about her past with her new friends, falling into a trance and wandering off on her own. Kuroko gets a call from Konori, who has discovered the Poltergeist incidents have been created on purpose, but another Poltergeist incident occurs near Kazari and Erii, who are saved from a falling lamppost by Therestina. As the girls slowly realize what has happened, a familiar woman is seen in the crowd below. 21 \"Voices\" \"Koe\" (\u58f0) February 26, 2010 Following the Poltergeist incident, Mikoto wonders if Kiyama is once again involved, though Kuroko reminds her that Kiyama is supposedly still in custody. Kuroko instead suspects Erii as the cause, since most of the Poltergeist attacks have been occurring at places she has been. Both of them do a clandestine background check on Erii and learn that, despite being a Level-2 telepathic esper, she can exhibit Level-4 powers under certain catalysts. Kazari takes Erii to the park, where Erii explains that she had been looking for a childhood friend. Erii goes into another trance, and a violent Poltergeist attack occurs at the park. Kazari becomes angry at Kuroko for suspecting Erii, so Therestina performs some tests on Erii at the MAR Base Research Laboratory to prove her innocence. Upon waking up, Erii explains to everyone that she falls into a trance upon hearing the voice of her friend, Banri Edasaki , who apparently is another telepath. When Erii shows everyone a photo of Banri inside her pendant, Mikoto recognizes Banri as one of Kiyama's Child Error students who went into a coma. 22 \"Level 6 (The One Who Obtains the Power of God Whilst Still Possessing a Mortal Body)\" \"Reberu Shikkusu (Kami Naranu Mi ni te Tenj\u014d no Ishi ni Tadoritsuku Mono)\" (\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb6\uff08\u795e\u306a\u3089\u306c\u8eab\u306b\u3066\u5929\u4e0a\u306e\u610f\u5fd7\u306b\u8fbf\u308a\u7740\u304f\u3082\u306e\uff09) March 5, 2010 Erii explains that both she and Banri were both telepaths who had grown up in an orphanage for Child Errors before Banri had moved, but she has recently begun hearing Banri suffering and has been trying to find her ever since. Mikoto explains about the Level Upper experiment to Therestina, who theorizes that Kiyama's comatose students are the cause of the Poltergeist incidents. However, this theory divides Kazari and Kuroko even more, as Kazari thinks Kuroko is now blaming them instead. The next day, Mikoto learns that Kiyama has been released from custody, later learning that the Poltergeists could potentially destroy Academy City if not resolved. Whilst investigating one of Gensei's old facilities, Mikoto encounters Kiyama herself, who shows her to a hospital where all of her comatose students are under the care of Heaven Canceller. He explains Gensei's conviction that an esper can become a Level 6 by taking Ability Crystals made from the essence of comatose espers who have lost control of their AIM fields. He has gathered the Child Errors and bailed Kiyama to find a cure, but without the \"First Sample\", the first test subject of Gensei's Ability Crystal program, their attempts at waking the students have caused Poltergeist incidents. Therestina, who followed Mikoto and Kiyama to their location, arrives and demands the children to her custody. Forced to choose, Mikoto takes Therestina's side to potentially give the children a chance, convincing the heartbroken Kiyama to put her trust in the authorities. 23 \"What Is It You See In Your Eyes Right Now?\" \"Ima, Anata no Me ni wa Nani ga Mietemasu ka?\" (\u3044\u307e\u3001\u3042\u306a\u305f\u306e\u76ee\u306b\u306f\u4f55\u304c\u898b\u3048\u3066\u307e\u3059\u304b\uff1f) March 12, 2010 Still feeling concerned, Kazari goes to see Kiyama and convinces her to share information with MAR to help her students. However, Therestina destroys Kiyama's data and refuses to let them see either Erii or the children. When Kazari tells her friends what happened, they learn that Therestina is in fact Gensei's granddaughter, who was the first test subject of his Ability Crystal program. Realizing she was tricked, Mikoto confronts a battle-suited Therestina at the MAR Base Research Laboratory, but is outmatched when Therestina uses Capacity Down on her, revealing she intends to finish Gensei's work. As Therestina and MAR leave with Erii and the children, Mikoto is rescued by Mitsuko, who had been resting nearby following a previous Poltergeist incident. When Mikoto awakens, she blames herself and attempts to go off on her own again. However, Ruiko stands in her way, reminding Mikoto that she does not have to do everything by herself and getting Kazari and Kuroko to make up with each other. Learning Kiyama is chasing after the MAR trailers to their destination, Mikoto, Kuroko, Kazari, Ruiko, Konori and Mitsuko head out to save Erii and the others. 24 \"Dear My Friends\" (Dear my Friends) March 19, 2010 Kiyama is after the MAR trailers, unaware they are decoys filled with the MAR Troops, but is saved by Mikoto. Kuroko, Mitsuko, Yomikawa, Tsuzuri and the Anti-Skills hold off the rest of the MAR Troops. Kiyama, Kazari and Ruiko head towards Kihara's laboratory, whilst Mikoto defends them from Therestina, who attacks with a giant large mech. Although Therestina's mech is unaffected by Mikoto's basic attacks, Kuroko helps Mikoto destroy the mech by using its own arm as an improvised railgun. Mikoto, Kuroko, Kazari, Ruiko and Kiyama finally arrive at the underground lab where Erii and the children are being held. However, Therestina, who had survived, suddenly activates the lab's Capacity Down and attacks the weakened espers, revealing her plan to use the First Sample from herself and the children to force Erii to become a Level 6 esper, destroying the city in the process. As all hope seems lost, Ruiko, the only one not affected by Capacity Down, destroys its controls, allowing Mikoto to defeat Therestina with her railgun. With the First Sample in hand, Kiyama creates the cure and finally awakens Banri and the other children, giving her thanks to Mikoto. In the aftermath, the recovering children give a birthday message to Kiyama via a blimp as Mikoto and her friends watch.

As Mikoto continues to feel this discomforting sensation everywhere, she starts to become very paranoid and afraid. Looking into a related rumor, Kuroko and the others learn other students have also been experiencing the same sensation. While Ruiko and Konori take Mikoto to the public bath, where Ruiko gives her some encouragement, Kuroko and Kazari interview Mitsuko, Maaya and Kinuho, whose senior is also one of the victims. Thanks to Ruiko's advice and Kuroko's research, Mikoto finds the culprit behind the sensations to be Asako Jonan, an Anti-Skill officer and former Nagatenj\u014dki Academy teacher. Having been fired from her teaching job, supposedly due to not being able to produce any Level 5 espers, Asako blamed Tokiwadai and used a device to produce special electromagnetic waves and cause discomfort in electromasters.

Upon learning of the situation from Aiho Yomikawa and Tsuzuri Tess\u014d , Mikoto heads to the rooftop to try and prevent the culprits escaping via helicopter. They throw Erii off the side of the building in order to break free, but she is saved thanks to Ruiko and Kuroko.

The next morning, Kuroko tries to take Mikoto through an alleyway to get to the mall, but they encounter a few people passing by. They discover this is due to someone hiding envelopes containing cash cards within the alleyways, piquing people's curiosity to search for them. After running into Ruiko, who is also on the hunt for the money cards, Mikoto overhears some Skill-Outs who have managed to locate the source of the envelopes and decides to follow them. Meanwhile, Ruiko grows curious as she had allegedly seen Mikoto at the mall, despite Mikoto never actually getting there, with Mii Konori explaining to Kazari about a rumor of there being clones of a Level 5 esper. The Skill-Outs eventually trace the envelopes back to a Nagatenj\u014dki Academy student, demanding she hand over the other envelopes. Things get tense, however, when it appears the Skill-Outs are gradually getting killed off by the girl, who claims to be able to freely kill anyone she has touched.

However, the girl leaves after inadvertently setting the building on fire whilst burning the evidence, simply stating Mikoto is better off not knowing as she would be unable to stop what was happening with her power. After saving the Skill-Outs, Mikoto looks up for information on the girl, whose name is revealed to be Shinobu Nunotaba , who actually worked at the same medical facility where she had given the scientists her DNA map years ago. Mikoto infiltrates the facility and comes across a room that is separate from the rest of the building's network. Mikoto hacks into database there and is shocked to learn that the scientists tricked her into giving them her DNA map in order to create clones called \"Sisters\", known as Project Radio Noise. However, the project was cancelled when the supercomputer, Tree Diagram, deduced that the clones would not come close to matching Mikoto's level of power. Believing there were not any clones of her after all, Mikoto feels relieved and leaves the facility, unaware of a clone arriving later to delete the database. 4 (28) \"Sisters\" \"Shisut\u0101zu\" (\u59b9\u9054\uff08\u30b7\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba\uff09) May 3, 2013 Three months earlier, in an unknown facility, a pair of women scientists, later recognized as Yumi Kusakabe and Eiga Kanmi, had mentored the birth of a clone of Mikoto, labelled Misaka 9982 , installing memory functions via a capsule-like machine called Testament. Back in the present, Mikoto, who is feeling cheerful with the clone rumors being seemingly debunked, goes shopping with Kuroko and the others at the mall, helping Kazari and Erii buy a rice cooker whilst also picking out things for an upcoming school trip. The next day, as Mikoto ends up having nothing to do, some young children, including the girl whose bag she previously found, pick up on her boredom and have her play with them. Noticing one of the kids wearing a Gekota badge, Mikoto frantically goes through a whole bunch of capsule vendors in order to win one for herself. As the day comes to an end, Mikoto suddenly senses a power identical to her own and, upon chasing after its source, comes across Misaka 9982. 5 (29) \"Project Level 6 Shift\" \"Reberu Shikkusu Shifuto Keikaku\" (\u7d76\u5bfe\u80fd\u529b\u9032\u5316\u8a08\u753b\uff08\u30ec\u30d9\u30eb6 \u30b7\u30d5\u30c8 \u3051\u3044\u304b\u304f\uff09) May 10, 2013 After unwillingly helping her rescue a kitten from a tree, Mikoto tries to question Misaka 9982, but is unable to learn much due to being unable to decipher a codeword. She instead decides to follow her around in case she returns to her base of operations, where they end up doing some surprisingly sisterly activities. Later that evening, as Misaka 9982 points out that she is not returning to her point of origin, Mikoto takes her leave after inadvertently giving her the Gekota badge she won earlier. After receiving some help from Kazari in deciphering the codeword she was told about, Mikoto is horrified to learn of Project Level 6 Shift, in which 20,000 Sisters from Project Radio Noise are to be killed in 20,000 battles in order to evolve Academy City's most powerful Level 5 esper, Accelerator , into a Level 6 esper. Whilst learning of this, Misaka 9982 engages in her assigned battle with the aforementioned Accelerator, finding herself helpless against his reflective abilities. Fleeing to a railway yard, she attempts a sneak attack on Accelerator using a planted mine, only for him to survive and tear off her leg. Mikoto arrives on the scene, only to look in horror as Accelerator crushes Misaka 9982 to death with a train, sending Mikoto into a furious rage. 6 (30) \"I... Can See All of You\" \"Atashi... Minna no Koto Miete Irukara\" (\u3042\u305f\u3057\u2026\u307f\u3093\u306a\u306e\u3053\u3068\u898b\u3048\u3066\u3044\u308b\u304b\u3089) May 17, 2013 Mikoto unleashes her anger at Accelerator, who quickly deduces she is the original, and becomes further enraged upon seeing Misaka 9982's torn leg and hearing Accelerator's selfish reasons for participating in the experiment. However, even her most powerful attacks are simply reflected back at her. Just then, the fight is halted by the arrival of dozens of other Sisters, who request that Accelerator stop fighting Mikoto to avoid throwing off the experiment's calculations. As Accelerator takes his leave, Mikoto feels no comfort in hearing the Sisters acknowledge themselves as nothing more than guinea pigs. After a restless night, Mikoto is approached by Shinobu, who explains why she chose to oppose the experiment. Having been called back from Project Radio Noise to assist in Project Level 6 Shift, Shinobu got to see the sensitive side of one of the Sisters and became unable to see them as anything other than human. Upon hearing this, Mikoto takes it upon herself to destroy the facilities involved in the experiment, keeping it a secret from Kuroko and the others. 7 (31) \"I... I Want To Be of Help To You, Sissy\" \"Onee-sama no Chikara ni Naritai desu no\" (\u304a\u59c9\u3055\u307e\u306e\u529b\u306b\u306a\u308a\u305f\u3044\u3067\u3059\u306e) May 24, 2013 Eliminating as many facilities involved with Project Level 6 Shift through electronic warfare before she is shut out from their communication lines, Mikoto starts spending several nights attacking the other facilities directly. Kuroko, who has grown concerned about Mikoto constantly being out at night, comes across a group of girls who are looking for a \"lucky card\", based on an urban legend spawned from the cash card incident. The next day, Kuroko encounters one of the girls, Minori, saving her from being hit by a car during her search, hearing how she wanted to find a lucky item for her friend who is moving away. After pointing out cash cards would be out of the question, since they would need to be turned into Judgment, Konori suggests that they instead search for a four-leaf clover . During their search, Kazari and Ruiko give Kuroko some assurance that Mikoto, along with themselves, appreciate her efforts. Both Kuroko and Minori find four-leaved clovers, with Kuroko keeping hers and resolving to always wait for Mikoto. Meanwhile, as Mikoto manages to dwindle down the remaining facilities to two, Kites Knockraven, a higher up in the project, prepare a counter-plan. 8 (32) \"ITEM\" \"Aitemu\" (ITEM\uff08\u30a2\u30a4\u30c6\u30e0\uff09) May 31, 2013 With only two facilities remaining, Knockraven calls upon the services of the mercenary team ITEM. As Mikoto infiltrates one of these facilities, she finds herself against one of its members, Frenda Seivelun , who causes trouble for her using flammable tape and stuffed dolls containing bombs. Meanwhile, Shinobu arrives at the other remaining facility, where they are attempting to transport the data whilst the other facility is being attacked. Mikoto chases down Frenda who, after a series of failed attacks, fills the room up with nitrogen, bluffing that it is an explosive gas to prevent Mikoto from using her electricity against her. However, Mikoto, refusing to simply give up and be killed, manages to fight back against Frenda, leading to her bluff becoming exposed. As Mikoto tries to interrogate Frenda, who is unable to respond due to being shocked by her, she is suddenly attacked by ITEM's leader and the fourth ranked Level 5 esper, Shizuri Mugino . 9 (33) \"AIM Stalker\" \"Ei Ai Emu Sut\u014dk\u0101\" (\u80fd\u529b\u8ffd\u8ff9\uff08AIM\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\uff09) June 7, 2013 Mikoto attempts to escape from Shizuri's attacks, which proves difficult due to ITEM's third member, Rik\u014d Takitsubo , using her AIM Stalker ability to help Shizuri and Frenda home their attacks on her position. Meanwhile, Shinobu, who felt Mikoto should not have to carry her burden alone, sneaks into the basement of her facility where the incubated Sisters are being held, hoping to install emotions into all of the remaining Sisters via the Misaka Network in the hopes that it may move the organizers to suspend the experiments. However, she is apprehended by ITEM's fourth member, Saiai Kinuhata , who was guarding the facility in case a second party was involved in the attacks. Shinobu manages to get the program installing, but it is suddenly blocked by an unforeseen error code. Shinobu fires a gun at Saiai to save herself, but her attack fails due to Saiai's Offense Armor ability and she is taken into custody. Back at the other facility, a weakened Mikoto is forced to use her ability to deflect Shizuri's Meltdowner attack, making her realize who the intruder's identity is. Learning of this, Shizuri decides to send the injured Frenda and exhausted Rik\u014d away so she can settle things with Mikoto herself. 10 (34) \"Meltdowner\" \"Merutodaun\u0101\" (\u539f\u5b50\u5d29\u3057\uff08\u30e1\u30eb\u30c8\u30c0\u30a6\u30ca\u30fc\uff09) June 14, 2013 Coming face to face with Shizuri, Mikoto uses some of the explosive dolls that Frenda inadvertently left behind to compensate for her weakened powers. Shizuri fights off these dolls by using silicon shards cards to divide her lasers, but Mikoto manages to knock her out with one of the remaining dolls. After finding and destroying the facility's data bank, Mikoto finds herself on the run from an angered Shizuri. Fleeing to a bridge, Mikoto manages to get the best of Shizuri by using Frenda's flammable tape to collapse the walkway underneath her and cause her to fall down. As Mikoto makes her escape, Shizuri manages to learn about Project Level 6 Shift from one of the staff and decides it would be more amusing to let Mikoto suffer. The next day, Mikoto investigates the remaining facility, only to find it completely abandoned, allegedly having gone bankrupt. Believing the experiments to finally be over, Mikoto comes across T\u014dma Kamij\u014d by the vending machines. 11 (35) \"The Vending Machine\" \"Jid\u014d Hanbaiki\" (\u81ea\u52d5\u8ca9\u58f2\u6a5f) June 21, 2013 Mikoto runs into T\u014dma, who appears to have trouble remembering who she is, and vandalizes a vending machine to spit out drinks to compensate for some money it had stolen from him. Kuroko arrives on the scene and, despite not being pleased over the presence of a supposed \"boyfriend\", feels relieved that Mikoto appears to be back to her cheerful self and takes her leave. However, Mikoto's joy is short-lived when another Sister, Misaka 10031, appears before her, telling her in private that the experiments are still ongoing. Horrified to learn more Sisters have died because of her, Mikoto ends up yelling at Misaka 10031 for reminding her of Misaka 9982. Later discovering that countless other facilities have picked up the experiment, Mikoto comes to realize that her enemy is Academy City itself. Meanwhile, Accelerator recalls how he was first approached about Project Level 6 Shift. Deciding that she will need to do something drastic in order to stop the experiments, Mikoto feels relieved that Kuroko would still perform her duty as a Judgment officer should she be labelled a criminal for doing so. 12 (36) \"Tree Diagram\" \"Tsur\u012b Daiaguramu\" (\u6a39\u5f62\u56f3\u306e\u8a2d\u8a08\u8005\uff08\u30c4\u30ea\u30fc\u30c0\u30a4\u30a2\u30b0\u30e9\u30e0\uff09) June 28, 2013 Mikoto resolves to hack into and destroy the Tree Diagram, the supercomputer responsible for the experiment's calculations, in the hope she may be able to stop them. Meanwhile, T\u014dma encounters Misaka 10032 , who coerces him into helping her look after an abandoned kitten she had found. As T\u014dma goes into a bookstore to look for a book to help him with his own cat, Misaka 10032 goes off to observe Accelerator as he begins his scheduled battle with Misaka 10031. Arriving at Tree Diagram's control center, hoping to hack into Tree Diagram to order a halt to the experiment, Mikoto is confused to find it not only heavily low on security, but completely abandoned as well. Hacking into the system, she is horrified to learn the truth, in that Tree Diagram had been destroyed for months, with the experiments continuing regardless. 13 (37) \"Accelerator\" \"Akuserar\u0113ta\" (\u4e00\u65b9\u901a\u884c\uff08\u30a2\u30af\u30bb\u30e9\u30ec\u30fc\u30bf\uff09) July 5, 2013 Mikoto falls in despair, realizing that with Tree Diagram destroyed, she has no way of stopping the experiments. She tries to cling onto her cause by mercilessly destroying another facility, but loses all hope when she sees a live feed of Misaka 10031 being killed by Accelerator. As Accelerator reminisces about his first experiment and his first time killing a Sister, T\u014dma discovers Misaka 10031's corpse and calls the Anti-Skills to investigate it, only to find it gone when they arrive, with no evidence it ever occurred. After the Anti-Skills leave, Misaka 10032 appears before T\u014dma, who comes to learn the true nature of the Sisters. Upon learning this, T\u014dma heads for the Tokiwadai dorms to try to get some answers from Mikoto, who at the same time is contemplating her last resort. 14 (38) \"The Promise\" \"Yakusoku\" (\u7d04\u675f) July 12, 2013 T\u014dma arrives at the Tokiwadai dorms, where he is reluctantly greeted by Kuroko, who decides to let him wait for Mikoto return. When the Tokiwadai Dorm Supervisor comes by for an inspection, Kuroko is forced to hide T\u014dma under Mikoto's bed due to his Imagine Breaker negating her teleportation. There, he finds the details concerning Project Level 6 Shift stuffed inside a teddy bear, learning that Misaka 10032's experiment is next. T\u014dma follows a trail of windmills to a bridge where he eventually finds Mikoto and confronts her about the experiments. With all her other efforts failed, Mikoto feels convinced that letting herself be killed by Accelerator is the only way to stop the experiments, proving she does not live up to Tree Diagram's expectations. However, T\u014dma, feeling her way will not save anyone, decides to stand in her way, refusing to fight back or even defend himself from Mikoto's lightning. Mikoto's emotions soon build up into a large shock wave that T\u014dma takes the full brunt of, helping her to see his resolve. After regaining consciousnesses and being greeted by a tearful Mikoto, T\u014dma comes up with the idea that if he as a Level 0 can defeat the Level 5 Accelerator in a fight and prove him to be actually weak, the entire basis for the experiments would fall apart. Despite Mikoto's objection, T\u014dma heads off to where Misaka 10032's experiment is being held. 15 (39) \"T\u014dma Kamij\u014d\" \"Kamij\u014d T\u014dma\" (\u6700\u5f31\uff08\u304b\u307f\u3058\u3087\u3046\u3068\u3046\u307e\uff09) July 19, 2013 Despite his injuries, T\u014dma arrives at the site where Accelerator and Misaka 10032 are fighting and states his firm desire to rescue the Sister, saying that even if she is a clone, there is only one of her in the entire world. As their fight begins, T\u014dma initially struggles against Accelerator as he launches projectiles at him and sets off a dust explosion . However, Accelerator is shocked when T\u014dma is able to punch him with his right hand without being affected by his ability, also coming as a surprise to Mikoto, who had also rushed to the scene. Angered, Accelerator starts using his ability to manipulate the wind, creating a huge hurricane that deals a lot of damage to T\u014dma. Mikoto attempts to go with her original plan in order to save T\u014dma, only to realize it would be futile upon witnessing Accelerator using his power to create a plasma storm that would wipe out everything in the area. Realizing what can be done to stop it, Mikoto goes over to Misaka 10032 and begs for her help in protecting T\u014dma's dream. Moved by these words, Misaka 10032 uses the Misaka Network to command the other Sisters in Academy City to manipulate the city's windmills with their electricity, affecting the wind and disrupting Accelerator's calculations, preventing him from stabilizing the plasma. As Mikoto prepares to stand off against Accelerator once more, T\u014dma gathers the strength to stand up. 16 (40) \"Sisterhood\" \"Shimai\" (\u59c9\u59b9) July 26, 2013 Accelerator demands to know why Mikoto is protecting Misaka 10032, to which she responds that it is simply because she is her sister. Before Accelerator can attempt to kill them, T\u014dma manages to regain his footing and uses the remainder of his strength to knock Accelerator out with one final punch. As he loses consciousness, Accelerator comes to the realization that the reason he wanted to become a Level 6 in the first place was so that he would not have to hurt anyone anymore. After the experiments are cancelled as a result of Accelerator's defeat, Mikoto goes to the hospital to visit T\u014dma, who assures her that even though many Sisters died, it was thanks to her that they got to be born in the first place. Afterwards, Mikoto takes a walk with Misaka 10032, where they play with another pair of sisters at the playground and think about the future that lies ahead. The next day, Mikoto borrows Ruiko's kitchen to make some handmade cookies for T\u014dma as thanks for his help. Despite not getting an opportunity to give them to him, Mikoto feels pleased when he finally calls her by her proper name. 17 (41) \"Study Group\" \"Benky\u014d-kai\" (\u52c9\u5f37\u4f1a) August 2, 2013 When asked by the Dorm Supervisor to explain her absences, Mikoto bluffs that she was having study sessions with her friends. As Ruiko arranges a get together so she can hear who Mikoto was making cookies for the other day, Kuroko comes across Minori again before being dragged along by Mitsuko Kong\u014d to a pet shop. Meanwhile, Mikoto visits Heaven Canceller to hear about the status of the Sisters, learning they are being reconfigured so they may live longer than their originally intended two year lifespan. As Mikoto and Kuroko meet up at a family restaurant, they come across Shizuri and Frenda, leading to an awkward argument between Kuroko and Frenda over their respective partners, which is inevitably followed by an explosive punishment. After having a nabe party with everyone, Kuroko is relieved to see Mikoto back to her usual self. 18 (42) \"Moving\" \"O Hikkoshi\" (\u304a\u5f15\u8d8a\u3057) August 16, 2013 [7] A mysterious organization oversees ITEM as they fight against a group of mechs. The next day, Mikoto and the gang visit Banri, who is due to be discharged from the hospital soon and will be moving into an apartment with Erii, who will be moving out of Kazari's apartment as a result. As the gang discuss about the move, Kuroko and Kazari reveals Judgement will be on duty for the upcoming Academy City Research Exhibition Assembly, where Academy City's top genius students will attend. Meanwhile, Mitsuko uses her power to stop a purse thief, only to be berated by a certain man for her actions. As the group gets together to celebrate Banri's dischargement, Kuroko and Kazari are called off for Judgment duties when the city's traffic signals suddenly go out. After finishing her duties, Kazari gives a box of taiyaki to Erii, serving as a memento of when she first told Erii about her ability of temperature preservation, and the two have a tearful farewell as roommates. As the group take a detour home, they come across a curious white-haired girl named Febri , who appears to know Mikoto. Meanwhile, the mysterious organization begins their next plan to show their power against espers. 19 (43) \"Academic Research Assembly\" \"Gakuentoshi Kenky\u016b Happy\u014dkai\" (\u5b66\u5712\u90fd\u5e02\u7814\u7a76\u767a\u8868\u4f1a) August 23, 2013 The girls are unable to find out any more information from Febri, who appears to be a bit cautious around Mikoto and takes a liking with Ruiko. After Febri spends a night with Ruiko at Kazari's apartment, the group, believing Febri to be a Child Error, make arrangements for her to be moved to the orphanage in Asunaro Park in a week. As the gang heads to where the Academy City Research Exhibition Assembly will be held, Ruiko sets up some time for Mikoto to get along with Febri on their own. When Febri wanders off while Mikoto is not looking, the man from before spots her and sends some security bots after her. Luckily, Mikoto manages to rescue Febri, who apologizes for making her worry and comes to accept her. With Mikoto now involved, the man and his colleagues decide to include her in their experiments. 20 (44) \"Febri\" \"Feburi\" (\u30d5\u30a7\u30d6\u30ea) August 30, 2013 As Yomikawa becomes curious over how the security bots functioned without any batteries, Konori treats Mikoto and the others by taking them to the public baths, where Mikoto lets Febri keep her rare pink Gekota finger puppet from her collection. Whilst heading home, the girls are led on a detour to a warehouse, where they are attacked by a mech. As Mikoto fights against the mech, which seems resiliant to her electricity, the mech suddenly stops functioning when it comes close to attacking Febri, allowing Mitsuko to defeat it with her Aero Hand ability. After Mikoto discovers the mech to be curiously unmanned, Febri comes down with a fever and is admitted into the hospital. Meanwhile, it is shown that Shinobu is working with the group targeting Febri. Back at the hospital, Mitsuko informs the others about how she, Kinuho Wannai and Maaya Awatsuki came to learn that the man from before was attempting to \"reclaim\" Febri. The next morning as Febri seems to make a full recovery, Heaven Canceller informs Mikoto in private that Febri is in fact an artificial human. 21 (45) \"Darkness\" \"Yami\" (\u95c7) September 6, 2013 Heaven Canceller goes on to explain to Mikoto that Febri's body secretes a poison, requiring her to suck special lollipops to neutralize it, leaving her angry that another dark organization is performing twisted experiments. Whilst keeping this a secret from the others, Mikoto runs into Misaka 10032 who, having visited Febri the previous night, informs her that Febri had been wanting to meet her own big sister. She also reveals Febri gained her knowledge via Testament, leading Mikoto to believe Shinobu is involved. After receiving a call from Mitsuko about the importance of trusting friends, Mikoto realizes she should not have to do this alone and decides to inform Kuroko and the others about Febri's condition, becoming surprised and relieved to find they are more than willing to help. As Mikoto and her friends tries to find clues related to Febri, Yomikawa gives Mikoto a capsule found in the unmanned mech suit. Heaven Canceller examines the capsule which contains a strand of hair similar to Febri's, possibly belonging to her sister. However, he also reveals to Mikoto that Febri only has enough lollipops to stay alive for another 72 hours. With Mikoto deciding to face the darkness of Academy City once more in order to save Febri, Heaven Canceller arranges for her to meet someone familiar with the underground, that being Therestina Kihara Lifeline . 22 (46) \"STUDY\" (STUDY) September 13, 2013 Despite being mocked by Therestina, Mikoto refuses to leave until she gets information to save Febri. Therestina hesitantly reveals that Febri is an artificial human called a Chemicaloid, which her creators were going to showcase at the Academy City Research Exhibition Assembly. Mikoto tells the others about Febri's condition. Mitsuko, Kinoho and Maaya help Kazari identify the mysterious man as Haruki Aritomi, a longtime winner of the Academy City Research Exhibition Assembly. Kazari discovers that Aritomi and other student geniuses formed the STUDY Corporation and purchased a factory, which Kazari suspects is where Febri and her lollipops were being made. Mikoto heads to the factory, spots ITEM fighting mechs sent by STUDY and overhears that the mechs are controlled via a form of psychogenesis by the capsules inside them. After ITEM leaves, Mikoto enters the factory and finds Shinobu, who had taught Febri how to say Mikoto's name so she would be protected by her. Shinobu gives Mikoto the data to make more neutralizer lollipops, only to learn from Aritomi that the information is fake, as this confirms that he suspected Shinobu was a traitor. Aritomi orders Shinobu to inject Mikoto with a tranquilizer in exchange the real neutralizer data, but after Shinobu does it, Aritomi breaks his word and destroys the data. Febri is revealed to be a spare to his true project, Janie. 23 (47) \"Dawn of a Revolution (Silent Party)\" \"Kakumei Mimei\" (\u9769\u547d\u672a\u660e\uff08Silent Party\uff09) September 20, 2013 Aritomi reveals he started Project Chemicaloid, which created Janie and Febri due to his bitterness that espers gain fame and recognition while intellectuals like him are ignored. To finally show their power, STUDY found a way to mass-produce espers which will bring forth a revolution upon Academy City tomorrow. Later, Shinobu explains to Mikoto how she was sold to STUDY after being captured by ITEM and was forced to work on the Chemicaloids, which were born from her research, becoming determined to save them. Using her own electricity to counter the paralysis in her body, Mikoto assures Shinobu that she does not need to take everything on by herself. Kuroko and the others arrive to rescue Mikoto, whilst Shinobu chooses to stay behind in order to do her part. After learning that 20,000 mechs, controlled by Janie's Diffusion Ghost ability, have been snuck into the Academy City Research Exhibition Assembly, with the Anti-Skills prevented from interfering, the girls make preparations to save Shinobu, Febri and Janie. The next morning, Kuroko, Kazari, Ruiko, Konori, Mitsuko, Kinoho and Maaya step up to face the mechs, whilst Mikoto and Febri head off in search of Janie. 24 (48) \"Eternal Party\" (Eternal Party) September 27, 2013 The entirety of Judgment joins Kuroko and the others in fighting off against STUDY's mechs. Meanwhile, Mikoto and Febri arrive at STUDY's hidden base at a stadium, fighting off against the mechs that Aritomi sends against them. STUDY responds by sending a signal to cut off everyone's communications and sending more advanced mechs after each group. However, they overcome this thanks to Erii and Banri setting up a network of telepaths, with Kazari and Ruiko piloting their own mech that Mitsuko's father sent over, whilst ITEM help to destroy the mechs sent after Mikoto. Mikoto and Febri soon arrive at the underground base, where Aritomi, having no other plans to stop her, resorts to initiating the final phase in which he reveals his secret weapon: a cluster missile from space containing Diffusion Ghost that will destroy Academy City and everyone who is in it, by causing a chain reaction with the city's AIM fields. Aritomi attempts to kill himself, only to be stopped by Mikoto, who is determined to save everyone. With the assistance of the Sisters, Mikoto rides in Mitsuko's mech and launches into the atmosphere, using the mech as ammunition for a massive railgun to destroy the missile. After freeing Janie from STUDY's control and reuniting her with Febri, who is given more neutralizer lollipops, Shinobu makes plans to bring the twins to an overseas research facility to cure their condition. After saying their goodbyes to Shinobu and the twins, Mikoto and the gang discuss their upcoming vacation. Bonus \"All the Important Things I Learned in a Bathhouse\" \"Daiji na Koto wa Zenbu Sent\u014d ni Osowatta\" (\u5927\u4e8b\u306a\u3053\u3068\u306f\u305c\u3093\u3076\u92ad\u6e6f\u306b\u6559\u308f\u3063\u305f) March 27, 2014 [8] As the local bathhouse comes under threat of being closed down, Mii enlists the help of Mikoto, Kuroko, Kazari and Ruiko to help promote interest, coming up with a Mikoto-powered \"electric bath\" to bring in more customers. At first, the baths become a success which attracts the attention of Erii, Mitsuko, Wannai, Atsuki, Yomikawa, Tsuzuri, Komoe, Shizuri, Frenda, Saiai, Rik\u014d and the Dorm Supervisor. However, the baths are almost ruined after Kuroko adds too much bubble bath soap in one of her schemes to seduce Mikoto.

(October 2017) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) First/given, middle, and last/family/surname with John Fitzgerald Kennedy as example. This shows a structure typical for English-speaking cultures (and some others). Other cultures use other structures for full names. First/given, middle, and last/family/surname diagram with J. S. Bach as example. J. S. Bach shared his given name with six immediate family members and many extended family members. He shared his family name with most family members. A surname , family name , or last name is the portion of a personal name that indicates a person's family (or tribe or community, depending on the culture). [1] Depending on the culture all members of a family unit may have identical surnames or there may be variations based on the cultural rules. In the English-speaking world , a surname is commonly referred to as a last name because it is usually placed at the end of a person's full name, after any given names. In many parts of Asia, as well as some parts of Europe and Africa, the family name is placed before a person's given name. In most Spanish-speaking and Portuguese-speaking countries, two surnames are commonly used and in some families that claim a connection to nobility even three are used. Surnames have not always existed and today are not universal in all cultures. This tradition has arisen separately in different cultures around the world. In Europe, the concept of surnames became popular in the Roman Empire and expanded throughout the Mediterranean and Western Europe as a result. During the Middle Ages this practice died out as Germanic, Persian, and other influences took hold. During the late Middle Ages surnames gradually re-emerged, first in the form of bynames (typically indicating individual's occupation or area of residence), which gradually evolved into modern surnames. In China surnames have been the norm since at least the 2nd century BC. [2] A family name is typically a part of a person's personal name which, according to law or custom, is passed or given to children from one or both of their parents' family names. The use of family names is common in most cultures around the world, with each culture having its own rules as to how these names are formed, passed and used. However, the style of having both a family name (surname) and a given name (forename) is far from universal . In many cultures, it is common for people to have one name or mononym , with some cultures not using family names. In most Slavic countries , as well as other countries including Greece and Iceland , for example, there are different family name forms for male and female members of the family. Issues of family name arise especially on the passing of a name to a new-born child, on the adoption of a common family name on marriage, on renouncing of a family name and on changing of a family name. Surname laws vary around the world. Traditionally in many European countries for the past few hundred years, it was the custom or law that a woman would on marriage use the surname of her husband and that children of a man would have the father's surname. If a child's paternity was not known, or if the putative father denied paternity, the new-born child would have the surname of the mother. That is still the custom or law in many countries. The surname for children of married parents is usually inherited from the father. [3] In recent years there has been a trend towards equality of treatment in relation to family names, with women being not automatically required or expected, or in some places even forbidden, to take the husband's surname on marriage, and children not automatically being given the father's surname. In this article, family name and surname both mean the patrilineal surname, handed down from or inherited from the father's, unless explicitly stated otherwise. Thus, the term \"maternal surname\" means the patrilineal surname which one's mother inherited from either or both of her parents. For a discussion of matrilineal ('mother-line') surnames, passing from mothers to daughters, see matrilineal surname . In English-speaking cultures , family names are often used by children when referring to adults, but are also used to refer to someone in authority, the elderly, or in a formal setting, and are often used with a title or honorific such as Mr. , Mrs. , Ms. , Miss , Doctor , and so on. It is also common in English-speaking cultures for individuals to be referred to by their surname instead of their given name by their friends. Generally the given name , first name, forename, or personal name is the one used by friends, family, and other intimates to address an individual. It may also be used by someone who is in some way senior to the person being addressed. This practice also differs between cultures; see T\u2013V distinction . The study of proper names (in family names, personal names, or places) is called onomastics . A one-name study is a collection of vital and other biographical data about all persons worldwide sharing a particular surname.

In other cultures the surname is placed first, followed by the given name or names. The latter is often called the Eastern order because Europeans are most familiar with the examples from the East Asian cultural sphere , specifically Japan , China and Taiwan , Korea (Republic of Korea and Democratic People's Republic of Korea) and Vietnam . This is also the case in Hungary , parts of Romania , Bavaria , Austria , Albania and Kosovo , parts of South India , Sri Lanka , and Madagascar . Since family names are normally written last in European societies (except in Hungary), the term last name is commonly used for family name, while in Japan (with vertical writing) the family name may be referred to as upper name ( ue-no-namae ( \u4e0a\u306e\u540d\u524d ) ). When those from Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong write their personal name in the Latin alphabet , it is common to reverse the order of the given and family names for the convenience of Westerners, so that they know which name is the family name for official/formal purposes. Reversing the order of names for the same reason is also customary for the Baltic Fennic peoples and the Hungarians , but other Uralic peoples traditionally did not have surnames, perhaps because of the clan structure of their societies. The Samis saw no change or a transformation of their name. For example: some Sire became Siri, [4] H\u00e6tta J\u00e1hko\u0161 \u00c1sslat became Aslak Jacobsen H\u00e6tta \u2014 as was the norm . Recently, integration into the EU and increased communications with foreigners prompted many Samis to reverse the order of their full name to given name followed by surname, to avoid their given name being mistaken for and used as a surname. Indian surnames may often denote caste , profession, and village and are invariably mentioned along with the personal names. However, hereditary last names are not universal. In Indian passports the surname is shown first. In telephone directories the surname is used for collation . In North Indian states the surname is placed after given names where it exists. In parts of south India, surname is placed before personal name and in most cases it is only shown as an initial (for example 'S.' for Suryapeth). [ citation needed ] In English and other languages like Spanish\u2014although the usual order of names is \"first middle last\"\u2014for the purpose of cataloging in libraries and in citing the names of authors in scholarly papers, the order is changed to \"last, first middle,\" with the last and first names separated by a comma, and items are alphabetized by the last name. [5] [6] In France , Italy , Spain , Belgium and Latin America , administrative usage is to put the surname before the first on official documents. [ citation needed ] History [ edit ] While given names have been used from the most distant times [ vague ] to identify individuals, the advent of surnames is a relatively recent [ when? ] phenomenon. [7] A four-year study led by the University of the West of England , which concluded in 2016, analysed sources dating from the 11th to the 19th century to explain the origins of the surnames in the British isles . [8] The study found that over 90% of the 45,602 surnames in the dictionary are native to Britain and Ireland, with the most common in the UK being Smith , Jones , Williams , Brown , Taylor , Johnson , and Lee . [8] The findings have been published in the Oxford English Dictionary of Family Names in Britain and Ireland , with project leader, Professor Richard Coates calling the study \"more detailed and accurate\" than those before. [8] He elaborated on the origins; \"Some surnames have origins that are occupational - obvious examples are Smith and Baker . Other names can be linked to a place, for example Hill or Green , which relates to a village green. Surnames which are 'patronymic' are those which originally enshrined the father's name - such as Jackson , or Jenkinson . There are also names where the origin describes the original bearer such as Brown, Short , or Thin - though Short may in fact be an ironic 'nickname' surname for a tall person.\" [8] By 1400, most English and some Scottish people used surnames, but many Scottish and Welsh people did not adopt surnames until the 17th century, or later. Henry VIII (ruled 1509\u20131547) ordered that marital births be recorded under the surname of the father. [7] In England and cultures derived from there, there has long been a tradition for a woman to change her surname upon marriage from her birth name to her husband's family name. (See Maiden and married names .) The first known instance in the United States of a woman insisting on the use of her birth name was that of Lucy Stone in 1855; and there has been a general increase in the rate of women using their birth name. This has gone through periods of flux, however, and the 1990s saw a decline in the percentage of name retention among women. [ citation needed ] As of 2006, more than 80% of American women adopted the husband's family name after marriage. [9] Many cultures have used and continue to use additional descriptive terms in identifying individuals. These terms may indicate personal attributes, location of origin, occupation, parentage, patronage, adoption, or clan affiliation. These descriptors often developed into fixed clan identifications that in turn became family names as we know them today. In China, according to legend, family names started with Emperor Fu Xi in 2852 BC. [10] [11] His administration standardised the naming system in order to facilitate census-taking, and the use of census information. Originally, Chinese surnames were derived matrilineally, [12] although by the time of the Shang dynasty (1600 to 1046 BCE) they had become patrilineal. [12] [13] Chinese women do not change their names upon marriage. They can be referred to either as their full birth names or as their husband's surname plus the word for wife. In the past, women's given name were often not publicly known and women were referred in official documents by their family name plus the character \"Shi\" and when married by their husband's surname, their birth surname, and the character \"Shi.\" [ citation needed ] In Japan , family names were uncommon except among the aristocracy until the 19th century. [14] In Ancient Greece, during some periods, formal identification commonly included place of origin. [15] At other times clan names and patronymics (\"son of\") were also common, as in Aristides Lysimachu . For example, Alexander the Great was known as Heracleides , as a supposed descendant of Heracles , and by the dynastic name Karanos / Caranus , which referred to the founder of the dynasty to which he belonged . In none of these cases, though, were these names considered essential parts of the person's name, nor were they explicitly inherited in the manner that is common in many cultures today. In the Roman Empire, the bestowal and use of clan and family names waxed and waned with changes in the various subcultures of the realm. ( See Roman naming conventions . ) The nomen, which was the gens name, was inherited much like last names are, but their purposes were quite different [ how? ] . In later [ when? ] Europe, last names were developed to distinguish between individuals. The nomen were to identify group kinship. The praenomen was the \"forename\" and was originally used like a first name today. In later times [ when? ] , praenomen became less useful for distinguishing individuals as it was often passed down for males along with the nomen (like an entire culture where \"John Smith, Jr.\" was the norm), and females, were often given no praenomen at all or functional names like Major and Minor (\"Older\" and \"Younger\") or Maxima, Maio, and Mino (\"Biggest,\" \"Middle,\" \"Littlest\") or ordinal numbers rather than what we might think of as names: Prima, Secunda, Tertia, Quarta, etc. Around this time, [ when? ] the nomen became followed by one or more additional names called cognomen. It became usual that one of these cognomen was inherited, but as the praenomen and nomen became more rigidly used and less useful for identifying individuals, additional personal cognomen were more often used, to the point that the first the praenomen and then the nomen fell out of use entirely. [ when? ] With the gradual influence of Greek and Christian culture throughout the Empire, Christian religious names were sometimes put in front of traditional cognomen, but eventually, people reverted to single names. [16] By the time of the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, family names were uncommon in the Eastern Roman Empire . In Western Europe, where Germanic culture dominated the aristocracy, family names were almost non-existent. They would not significantly reappear again in Eastern Roman society until the 10th century, apparently influenced by the familial affiliations of the Armenian military aristocracy. [16] The practice of using family names spread through the Eastern Roman Empire and gradually into Western Europe, although it was not until the modern era that family names came to be explicitly inherited as they are today. In Ireland, the use of surnames has a very old history. Ireland was the first country in Europe to use fixed surnames [ citation needed ] . As noted in the Annals, the first recorded fixed [ citation needed ] surname was \u00d3 Cleirigh, which recorded the death of Tigherneach Ua Cleirigh, lord of Aidhne in Galway in the year 916. [17] In England, the introduction of family names is generally attributed to the preparation of the Domesday Book in 1086, [ citation needed ] following the Norman conquest . Evidence indicates that surnames were first adopted among the feudal nobility and gentry, and slowly spread to other parts of society. Some of the early Norman nobility who arrived in England during the Norman conquest differentiated themselves by affixing 'de' (of) before the name of their village in France. This is what is known as a territorial surname, a consequence of feudal landownership. In medieval times in France, such a name indicated lordship, or ownership, of the village. Some early Norman nobles in England chose [ citation needed ] to drop the French derivations and call themselves instead after their new English holdings. Surnames were uncommon prior to the 12th century, and still somewhat rare into the 13th; most European surnames were originally occupational or locational, and served to distinguish one person from another if they happened to live near one another (e.g., two different people named John could conceivably be identified as 'John Butcher' and 'John Chandler'). This still happens, in some communities where a surname is particularly common. In the Middle Ages, when a man from a lower-status family married an only daughter from a higher-status family, he would often adopt the wife's family name. [ citation needed ] In the 18th and 19th centuries in Britain, bequests were sometimes made contingent upon a man's changing (or hyphenating) his family name, so that the name of the testator continued. It is rare but not unknown for an English-speaking man to take his wife's family name, whether for personal reasons or as a matter of tradition (such as among matrilineal Canadian aboriginal groups, such as the Haida and Gitxsan ); it is exceedingly rare but does occur in the United States, where a married couple may choose an entirely new last name by going through a legal change of name. As an alternative, both spouses may adopt a double-barrelled name . For instance, when John Smith and Mary Jones marry each other, they may become known as \"John Smith-Jones\" and \"Mary Smith-Jones\". A spouse may also opt to use their birth name as a middle name. [ citation needed ] An additional option, although rarely practiced [ citation needed ] , is the adoption of a last name derived from a blend of the prior names, such as \"Simones\", which also requires a legal name change. Some couples keep their own last names but give their children hyphenated or combined surnames. [18] In medieval Spain , a patronymic system was used. For example, \u00c1lvaro, the son of Rodrigo would be named \u00c1lvaro Rodr\u00edguez. His son, Juan, would not be named Juan Rodr\u00edguez, but Juan \u00c1lvarez. Over time, many of these patronymics became family names and are some of the most common names in the Spanish-speaking world. Other sources of surnames are personal appearance or habit, e.g. Delgado (\"thin\") and Moreno ( polysemous word, it can mean \"brown skinned\", \"dark skinned\", \"tanned skinned\", \"brunette hair\" or \"black hair\"); occupations, e.g. Molinero (\"miller\"), Zapatero (\"shoe-maker\") and Guerrero (\"warrior\"); and geographic location or ethnicity, e.g. Alem\u00e1n (\"German\"). Modern era [ edit ] During the modern era, many cultures around the world adopted family names, particularly for administrative reasons, especially during the age of European expansion and particularly since 1600. Notable examples include the Netherlands (1795-1811), Japan (1870s), Thailand (1920), and Turkey (1934). Nonetheless, their use is not universal: Icelanders, Tibetans, Burmese, Javanese, and many people groups in East Africa do not use family names. Family names sometimes change or are replaced by non-family-name surnames under political pressure to avoid persecution. [ citation needed ] Examples are the cases with Chinese Indonesians and Chinese Thais after migration there during the 20th century, or the Jews who fled to different European countries to avoid persecution from the Nazis during World War II. The United States followed the naming customs and practices of English common law and traditions until recent [ when? ] times. Beginning in the latter half of the 20th century, traditional naming practices, writes one commentator, were recognized as \"com[ing] into conflict with current sensitivities about children's and women's rights.\" [19] Those changes accelerated a shift away from the interests of the parents to a focus on the best interests of the child. The law in this area continues to evolve today mainly in the context of paternity and custody actions. [20] Upon marriage to a woman, men in the United States can easily change their surnames to that of their wives, or adopt a combination of both names with the federal government, through the Social Security Administration . Men may face difficulty doing so on the state level in some states. In some places, civil rights lawsuits or constitutional amendments changed the law so that men could also easily change their married names (e.g., in British Columbia and California). [21] Qu\u00e9bec law permits neither spouse to change surnames. [22] UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women [ edit ] In 1979, the United Nations adopted the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (\"CEDAW\"), which declared in effect that women and men, and specifically wife and husband, shall have the same rights to choose a \"family name\", as well as a profession and an occupation. [23] For a further description of and treatment of this Convention, see Matriname . In France, until 1 January 2005, children were required by law to take the surname of their father. Article 311-21 of the French Civil code now permits parents to give their children the family name of either their father, mother, or a hyphenation of both \u2013 although no more than two names can be hyphenated. In cases of disagreement, the father's name applies. [24] This brought France into line with a 1978 declaration by the Council of Europe requiring member governments to take measures to adopt equality of rights in the transmission of family names, a measure that was echoed by the United Nations in 1979. [25] Similar measures were adopted by West Germany (1976), Sweden (1982), Denmark (1983) and Spain (1999). The European Community has been active in eliminating gender discrimination. Several cases concerning discrimination in family names have reached the courts. Burghartz v. Switzerland challenged the lack of an option for husbands to add the wife's surname to his surname, which they had chosen as the family name, when this option was available for women. [26] Losonci Rose and Rose v. Switzerland challenged a prohibition on foreign men married to Swiss women keeping their surname if this option was provided in their national law, an option available to women. [27] Unal Tekeli v. Turkey challenged prohibitions on women using their surname as the family name, an option only available to men. [28] The Court found all these laws to be in violation of the Convention. [29] Typology [ edit ] Only a fraction of surnames in English-speaking countries around the world come from Britain. English speakers' surnames come from all parts of Europe, as well as other continents, with varying anglicization . With a few exceptions, Europe's languages are cognate , so most European surnames have a common etymological origin. Some surnames are monogenetic (derived from one family at a specific place and time); others are polygenetic (coined independently at different places and times). [30] Basil Cottle classifies European surnames under four broad categories, depending on their origin: given name (patronymics), occupational name, local name (toponymics), and nickname. [31] This classification can be extended to surnames originating elsewhere. Other name etymologists use a fuller classification, but these four types underlie them. [30] Derived from a given name [ edit ] Main articles: Patronymic surname and Matronymic surname See also: Icelandic names , Habesha name , Arabic name , and Hebrew name See also: Category:Patronymic surnames . These are the oldest and most common type of surname. [30] They may be a first name such as \"Wilhelm\", a patronymic such as \" Andersen \", a matronymic such as \" Beaton \", or a clan name such as \" O'Brien \". Multiple surnames may be derived from a single given name: e.g. there are thought to be over 90 Italian surnames based on the given name \" Giovanni \". [30] A family tree showing the Icelandic patronymic naming system. The Icelandic system, formerly used in much of Scandinavia, does not use family names. A person's last name indicates the first name of their father ( patronymic ) or in some cases mother ( matronymic ). Many common family names in other Scandinavian countries are a result of this naming practice, such as Hansen (son of Hans ), Johansen (son of Johan ) and Olsen (son of Ole /Ola), the three most common surnames in Norway . [32] This also occurs in other cultures: Spanish and Portuguese (L\u00f3pez or Lopes, son of Lope; \u00c1lvarez or \u00c1lvares, son of \u00c1lvaro; Dom\u00ednguez or Domingues, son of Domingo or Domingos; etc.); in English (Johnson, son of John; Richardson, son of Richard), etc. Patronymic name conventions are similar in some other nations, including Malaysia (see Malaysian name ) and other Muslim countries, among most people of the Indian states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala (unlike another Indian state Andhra Pradesh , where ancestral origin village names have become surnames for the people), in Mongolia and in the Scottish Gaelic personal naming system . In Russia and Bulgaria , both patronymic and family name are obligatory parts of one's full name: e.g. if a Russian is called Ivan Andreyevich Sergeyev, that means that his father's name is Andrey and his family name is Sergeyev. A similar system is used in Greece . In Ethiopia and Eritrea , a child adopts the given name of one of their parents, usually the father, as a pseudo-surname. For example, Abraham Mesfin's father's first name would have been Mesfin, while Abraham Mesfin's child might be called \"Netsanet Abraham\". Just as in Iceland, referring to Abraham Mesfin as \"Mr Mesfin\" would be erroneous: the correct term would be \"Mr Abraham\". Very rarely do children adopt their mother's given name, who in any case would retain their \"pseudo-surname\". As part of Hebrew patronymic names , Ben is followed by the father's name, e.g. Ben Adam ( Hebrew : \u05d1\u05df \u05d0\u05d3\u05dd \u200e) or Abraham ben Abraham . Bar- , \"son of\" in Aramaic , is used likewise, e.g. Meir Bar-Ilan . Ben ( Hebrew : \u05d1\u05b6\u05bc\u05df \u200e, son of ) also forms part of Hebrew names , e.g. Benjamin . Patronymics , matronymics or ancestral , often from a person's given name. e.g., from male name: Richardson , Stephenson , Jones (Welsh for John), Williams , Jackson , Wilson , Thompson , Benson , Johnson , Harris , Evans , Simpson , Willis , Fox , Davies , Reynolds , Adams , Dawson , Lewis , Rogers , Murphy , Morrow , Nicholson , Robinson , Powell , Ferguson , Davis , Edwards , Hudson , Roberts , Harrison , Watson , or female names Molson (from Moll for Mary), Madison (from Maud), Emmott (from Emma), Marriott (from Mary) or from a clan name (for those of Scottish origin, e.g., MacDonald , Forbes , Henderson , Armstrong , Grant , Cameron , Stewart , Douglas , Crawford , Campbell , Hunter ) with \"Mac\" Gaelic for son. [33] Patronal from patronage ( Hickman meaning Hick's man, where Hick is a pet form of the name Richard) or strong ties of religion Kilpatrick (follower of Patrick ) or Kilbride (follower of Bridget ). There is a wide range of family name affixes with a patronymic function. Some are prefixes (e.g., Gaelic mac ) but more are suffixes. Occupational surname [ edit ] Occupational names include such simple examples as Smith (for a smith ), Miller (for a miller ), Farmer (for tax farmers or sometimes farmers ), Thatcher (for a thatcher ), Shepherd (for a shepherd ), Potter (for a potter ), and so on, as well as non-English ones, such as the German Eisenhauer (iron hewer , later Anglicized in America as Eisenhower ) or Schneider (tailor) - or, as in English, Schmidt (smith). There are also more complicated names based on occupational titles. In England it was common for servants to take a modified version of their employer's occupation or first name as their last name, adding the letter s to the word, although this formation could also be a patronymic . For instance, the surname Vickers is thought to have arisen as an occupational name adopted by the servant of a vicar, [34] while Roberts could have been adopted by either the son or the servant of a man named Robert. A subset of occupational names in English are names thought to be derived from the medieval mystery plays . The participants would often play the same roles for life, passing the part down to their oldest sons. Names derived from this may include King , Lord and Virgin . The original meaning of names based on medieval occupations may no longer be obvious in modern English (so the surnames Cooper , Chandler , and Cutler come from the occupations of making barrels, candles, and cutlery, respectively). Examples [ edit ] See also: Category:Occupational surnames . Archer , Bailey , Baker , Brewer , Butcher , Carpenter , Carter , Chandler , Clark or Clarke , Collier , Cooper , Cook , Dempster , Dyer , Farmer , Faulkner , Fisher , Fletcher , Fowler , Fuller , Gardener , Glover , Hayward , Hawkins , Head , Hunt or Hunter , Judge , Knight , Mason , Miller , Mower , Page , Palmer , Parker , Porter , Potter , Reeve or Reeves , Sawyer , Slater , Smith , Stringer , Taylor , Thatcher , Turner , Walker , Weaver , Woodman and Wright (or variations such as Cartwright and Wainwright ). Toponymic surname [ edit ] Main article: Toponymic surname Location (toponymic, habitation) names derive from the inhabited location associated with the person given that name. Such locations can be any type of settlement, such as: homesteads, farms, enclosures, villages, hamlets, strongholds or cottages. One element of a habitation name may describe the type of settlement. Examples of Old English elements are frequently found in the second element of habitational names. The habitative elements in such names can differ in meaning, according to different periods, different locations, or with being used with certain other elements. For example, the Old English element t\u016bn may have originally meant \"enclosure\" in one name, but can have meant \"farmstead\", \"village\", \"manor\", or \"estate\" in other names. Location names, or habitation names, may be as generic as \"Monte\" (Portuguese for \"mountain\"), \"G\u00f3rski\" (Polish for \"hill\") or \"Pitt\" (variant of \"pit\"), but may also refer to specific locations. \"Washington,\" for instance, is thought to mean \"the homestead of the family of Wassa\", [31] while \"Lucci\" means \"resident of Lucca \". [30] Although some surnames, such as \"London\", \"Lisboa\" or \"Bia\u0142ystok\" are derived from large cities, more people reflect the names of smaller communities, as in \u00d3 Creachmhaoil , derived from a village in County Galway . This is thought to be due to the tendency in Europe during the Middle Ages for migration to chiefly be from smaller communities to the cities and the need for new arrivals to choose a defining surname. [31] [35] In Portuguese-speaking countries , it is not uncommon to find surnames derived from names of countries, such as Portugal, Fran\u00e7a, Brasil, Holanda. Many Japanese surnames derive from geographical features; for example, Ishikawa (\u77f3\u5ddd) means \"stone river\", Yamamoto (\u5c71\u672c) means \"the base of the mountain\", and Inoue (\u4e95\u4e0a) means \"above the well.\" Arabic names sometimes contain surnames that denote the city of origin. For example, in cases of Saddam Hussein al Tikriti , [36] meaning Saddam Hussein originated from Tikrit , a city in Iraq . This component of the name is called a nisbah . Habitation (place) names e.g., Burton , Hamilton , London , Leighton , Murray , Sutton , Flint , Laughton Estate names For those descended from land-owners, the name of their holdings, castle, manor or estate, e.g. Ernle , Windsor , Staunton Topographic names (geographical features) e.g., Bridge , Camp , Hill , Bush , Lake , Lee , Wood , Grove , Holmes , Forest , Underwood , Hall , Brooks , Fields , Stone , Morley , Moore , Perry Derived from a nickname [ edit ] This is the broadest class of surnames, encompassing many types of origin. These include names, also known as eke-names, [37] based on appearance such as \"Schwartzkopf\", \"Short\", and possibly \"Caesar\", [30] and names based on temperament and personality such as \"Daft\", \"Gutman\", and \"Maiden\", which, according to a number of sources, was an English nickname meaning \"effeminate\". [30] [31] Personal characteristics e.g., Short , Brown , Black , Whitehead , Young , Long , White Ornamental surname [ edit ] Ornamental names used as surnames are more common in communities which adopted (or were forced to adopt) surnames in the 18th and 19th centuries. [35] They occur commonly among Jewish families, Germany, and in Scandinavia. [30] Examples include \"Morgenstern\" (\"morning star\"), \"Safire\" (\"sapphire\"), and \"Reis\" (\"branch\"). In some cases, such as Chinese Indonesians and Chinese Thais , certain ethnic groups are subject to political pressure to change their surnames, in which case surnames can lose their family-name meaning. For instance, Indonesian business tycoon Liem Swie Liong (\u6797\u7ecd\u826f) \"indonesianised\" his name to Sudono Salim . In this case \"Liem\" (\u6797) was rendered by \"Salim\", a name of Arabic origin, while \"Sudono\", a Javanese name with the honorific prefix \"su-\" (of Sanskrit origin), was supposed [ by whom? ] to be a rendering of \"Swie Liong\". During the era of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade many Africans lost their native names and were forced by their owners to take the owners' surnames and any given name the \"owner\" or slave master desired. In the Americas, the family names of many African-Americans have their origins in slavery ( i.e. slave name ). [ citation needed ] Many of them came to bear the surnames of their former owners. Many freed slaves either created family names themselves or adopted the name of their former master. [ citation needed ] Gender-specific versions of surname [ edit ] In some cultures, such as Greek, Bulgarian, Russian, Slovak, Czech, etc. surnames change form depending on the gender of the bearer. For example, in Greece, if a man called Papadopoulos has a daughter, she will likely be named Papadopoulou (if the couple have decided their offspring will take his surname), since that name has a female version. In Poland , if the husband is named Podwi\u0144ski, and his wife takes his surname, her last name, and those of their unmarried daughters, would be Podwi\u0144ska. The sons would be known as Podwi\u0144ski. In Lithuania, if the husband is named Vilkas, his wife will be named Vilkien\u0117 and his daughter will be named Vilkait\u0117. In Slovakia and Czech Republic alike, if a man is called Nov\u00e1k, the wife adds a feminine suffix \"-ov\u00e1\" to his surname after the marriage, hence Nov\u00e1kov\u00e1. The same is true for daughters, who almost always inherit the father's surname with the feminine suffix. Other [ edit ] The meanings of some names are unknown or unclear. The most common European name in this category may be the Irish name \" Ryan \", which means little king in Irish Gaelic. [31] [34] Other surnames may have arisen from more than one source: the name \"De Luca\", for instance, likely arose either in or near Lucania or in the family of someone named Lucas or Lucius; [30] in some instances, however, the name may have arisen from Lucca, with the spelling and pronunciation changing over time and with emigration. [30] The same name may appear in different cultures by coincidence or romanization; the surname Lee is used in English culture, but is also a romanization of the Chinese surname Li . [34] Surname origins have been the subject of much folk etymology . In French Canada until the 19th century, several families adopted surnames that followed the family name in order to distinguish the various branches of a large family. Such a surname was preceded by the word \"dit\" (\"said\") and was known as a \"nom-dit\" (\"said-name\"). (Compare with some Roman naming conventions .) While this tradition is no longer in use, in many cases the nom-dit has come to replace the original family name. Thus the Bourbeau family has split into Bourbeau dit Verville, Bourbeau dit Lacourse, and Bourbeau dit Beauchesne. In many cases Verville, Lacourse, or Beauchesne has become the new family name. Likewise, the Rivard family has split into the Rivard dit Lavigne, Rivard dit Loranger and Rivard dit Lanoie. The origin of the nom-dit can vary. Often it denoted a geographical trait of the area where that branch of the family lived: Verville lived towards the city, Beauchesne lived near an oak tree, Larivi\u00e8re near a river, etc. Some of the oldest noms-dits are derived from the war name of a settler who served in the army or militia: Tranchemontagne (\"mountain slasher\"), Jolic\u0153ur (\"braveheart\"). Others denote a personal trait: Lacourse might have been a fast runner, Legrand was probably tall, etc. Compound surnames [ edit ] Main article: Double-barrelled name While surnames are usually one word, in some cases a surname comprises more than one word. Spanish compound surnames [ edit ] Main article: Spanish naming customs Further information: Double-barrelled name \u00a7\u00a0Iberian tradition In traditional Spanish culture, and as is still the case in many Spanish-speaking countries, an individual does not have only a single surname. Instead an individual inherits the surnames of all of their ancestors, in particular their father and mother. In practice individuals mostly use only the two surnames of their parents. For instance, Spanish ex-premier Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero has Jos\u00e9 Luis as his given name, Rodr\u00edguez , as his first (i.e. paternal) surname, and Zapatero as his second (i.e. maternal) surname. But in reality an individual can be referred to by any number of his or her surnames as the occasion may require. For example, Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero could also be referred to as Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero Garc\u00eda Valero Garc\u00eda Asensio Additional surnames refer to grandmothers, great-grandmothers, and so forth. The number of surnames a person has is theoretically unlimited though it is rare to use more than a few (and indeed an individual may not know more than a few of his or her ancestors' names). This custom is not seen in the Hispanic world as being a true compound surname system per se , since it is widely understood that the first surname denotes one's father's family, and the second surname denotes one's mother's family. So \"Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero\" is not considered one surname; it is two distinct surnames. Given that it is not a true compound surname, his children do not inherit the \"compound\" surname \"Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero.\" Only the paternal surname of both father and mother are passed on. The father's paternal surname becomes the child's own paternal surname, while the mother's paternal surname becomes the child's second surname (as the child's own maternal surname). Thus, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero would pass on only Rodr\u00edguez to his children as their first (i.e. paternal) surname. An additional complication is introduced by marriage. Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero's wife was born Sonsoles Espinosa D\u00edaz. Under Spanish tradition she is still known by that name, even after marriage. But she may also be known as Sonsoles Espinosa D\u00edaz de Rodr\u00edguez Sonsoles Espinosa de Rodr\u00edguez Sonsoles de Rodr\u00edguez These other forms, particularly the last, are becoming less common as they are increasingly seen as sexist (i.e. that a wife is expected to take her husband's name but not the other way around). [38] [39] Additionally, in Spain and some other countries it is becoming more common, in law and in practice, to allow placing the mother's name before the father's in a child's surname rather than insisting that the privilege belongs exclusively to the father. [40] True compound surnames [ edit ] Beyond this seemingly \"compound\" surname system in the Hispanic world, there are also true compound surnames in the Spanish-speaking countries. These true compound surnames are passed on and inherited as compounds. For instance, former Chairman of the Supreme Military Junta of Ecuador , General Luis Telmo Paz y Mi\u00f1o Estrella , has Luis as his first given name, Telmo as his middle name, the true compound surname Paz y Mi\u00f1o as his first (i.e. paternal) surname, and Estrella as his second (i.e. maternal) surname. Luis Telmo Paz y Mi\u00f1o Estrella is also known more casually as Luis Paz y Mi\u00f1o, Telmo Paz y Mi\u00f1o, or Luis Telmo Paz y Mi\u00f1o. He would never be regarded as Luis Estrella, Telmo Estrella, or Luis Telmo Estrella, nor as Luis Paz, Telmo Paz, or Luis Telmo Paz. This is because \"Paz\" alone is not his surname (although other people use the \"Paz\" surname on its own). In this case, Paz y Mi\u00f1o is in fact the paternal surname, being a true compound surname. His children, therefore, would inherit the compound surname \"Paz y Mi\u00f1o\" as their paternal surname, while Estrella would be lost, since the mother's paternal surname becomes the children's second surname (as their own maternal surname). \"Paz\" alone would not be passed on, nor would \"Mi\u00f1o\" alone. To avoid ambiguity, one might often informally see these true compound surnames hyphenated, for instance, as Paz-y-Mi\u00f1o. This is true especially in the English-speaking world , but also sometimes even in the Hispanic world, since to many Hispanics unfamiliar with this and other compound surnames, \"Paz y Mi\u00f1o\" might be inadvertently mistaken as \"Paz\" for the paternal surname and \"Mi\u00f1o\" for the maternal surname. Although Mi\u00f1o did start off as the maternal surname in this compound surname, it was many generations ago, around five centuries, that it became compounded, and henceforth inherited and passed on as a compound. Other surnames which started off as compounds of two or more surnames, but which merged into one single word, also exist. An example would be the surname Pazmi\u00f1o , whose members are related to the Paz y Mi\u00f1o, as both descend from the \"Paz Mi\u00f1o\" family of five centuries ago. \u00c1lava , Spain is known for its incidence of true compound surnames, characterized for having the first portion of the surname as a patronymic, normally a Spanish patronymic (i.e. from the Castilian language ) or more unusually a Basque language patronymic, followed by the preposition \"de\", with the second part of the surname being a local toponymic surname from \u00c1lava. English compound surnames [ edit ] Further information: Double-barrelled name \u00a7\u00a0British tradition Compound surnames in English and several other European cultures feature two (or occasionally more) words, often joined by a hyphen or hyphens. However, it is not unusual for compound surnames to be composed of separate words not linked by a hyphen, for example Iain Duncan Smith , a former leader of the British Conservative Party , whose surname is \"Duncan Smith\". A surname with the prefix \"Fitz\" can be spelled with the prefix as a separate word, as in \"Fitz William\", as well as \"FitzWilliam\" or \"Fitzwilliam\". Scottish and Irish compound surnames [ edit ] Irish surnames are the oldest surnames in Europe. The common prefixes \"\u00d3\" and \"Mac\" can be spelled with the prefix as a separate word, yielding \"\u00d3 Briain\" or \"Mac Millan\" as well as the anglicized \"O'Brien\" and \"MacMillan\" or \"Macmillan.\" Culture and prevalence [ edit ] Rank and frequency of some US surnames In the United States, 1,712 surnames cover 50% of the population, and about 1% of the population has the surname Smith, [41] which is also the most frequent English name and an occupational name (\"metal worker\"), a contraction, for instance, of blacksmith or other metalsmiths . Several American surnames are a result of corruptions or phonetic misappropriations of European surnames, perhaps as a result of the registration process at the immigration entry points. Spellings and pronunciations of names remained fluid in the United States until the Social Security System enforced standardization. Approximately 70% of Canadians have surnames that are of English, Irish, French, or Scottish derivation. According to some estimates, 85% of China's population shares just 100 surnames. The names Wang, Zhang and Li are the most frequent. [42] Spanish-speaking world [ edit ] Main articles: Spanish naming customs and Naming customs of Hispanic America In Spain and in most Spanish-speaking countries , the custom is for people to have two surnames. Usually the first surname comes from the father and the second from the mother, but it could be the other way round. When speaking or in informal situations only the first one is used, although both are needed for legal purpose. A child's first surname will usually be their father's first surname, while the child's second surname will usually be the mother's first surname. For example, if Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Torres and Mar\u00eda Acosta G\u00f3mez had a child named Pablo, then his full name would be Pablo Garc\u00eda Acosta. One family member's relationship to another can often be identified by the various combinations and permutations of surnames. Jos\u00e9 Garc\u00eda Torres Mar\u00eda Acosta G\u00f3mez Pablo Garc\u00eda Acosta In some instances, when an individual's given name and first family name are too common (such as in Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero and Mario Vargas Llosa ), both family names are used (though not necessarily both given names). A person could even take the maternal name for informal situations instead of the paternal name, for personal preferences or if the maternal name is somehow \"special\" (Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero is known in Spanish as \"Jos\u00e9 Luis Zapatero\" or just as \"Zapatero\"). In Spain, a new law approved in 1999 allows an adult to change the order of his/her family names, and parents can also change the order of their children's family names if they (and the child, if over 12) agree. [43] In Spain, especially Catalonia , the paternal and maternal surnames are often combined using the conjunction y (\"and\" in Spanish ) or i (\"and\" in Catalan ), see for example the economist Xavier Sala-i-Martin or painter Salvador Dal\u00ed i Dom\u00e8nech . In Spain, a woman does not change her legal surnames when she marries. In some Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America , a woman may, on her marriage, drop her mother's surname and add her husband's surname to her father's surname using the preposition de (\"of\"), del (\"of the\", when the following word is masculine) or de la (\"of the\", when the following word is feminine). For example, if \"Clara Reyes Alba\" were to marry \"Alberto G\u00f3mez Rodr\u00edguez\", the wife could use \"Clara Reyes de G\u00f3mez\" as her name (or \"Clara Reyes G\u00f3mez\", or, rarely, \"Clara G\u00f3mez Reyes\". She can be addressed as Sra . de G\u00f3mez corresponding to \"Mrs G\u00f3mez\"). In some countries, this form may be mainly social and not an official name change, i.e. her name would still legally be her birth name. This custom of adding the husband's surname is slowly fading. Sometimes a father transmits his combined family names, thus creating a new one e.g., the paternal surname of the son of Javier (given name) Reyes (paternal family name) de la Barrera (maternal surname) may become the new paternal surname Reyes de la Barrera . De is also the nobiliary particle used with Spanish surnames. This can not be chosen by the person, as it is part of the surname, for example \"Puente\" and \"Del Puente\" are not the same surname. Children take the surnames of both parents, so if the couple above had two children named \"Andr\u00e9s\" and \"Ana\", then their names would be \"Andr\u00e9s G\u00f3mez Reyes\" and \"Ana G\u00f3mez Reyes\". In Spain , a 1995 reform in the law allows the parents to choose whether the father's or the mother's surname goes first, although this order must be the same for all their children. For instance, the name of the son of the couple in the example above could be either \"Andr\u00e9s G\u00f3mez Reyes\" or \"Andr\u00e9s Reyes G\u00f3mez\". [44] Sometimes, for single mothers or when the father would or could not recognize the child, the mother's surname has been used twice: for example, \"Ana Reyes Reyes\". In Spain, however, children with just one parent receive both surnames of that parent, although the order may also be changed. In 1973 in Chile, the law was changed to avoid stigmatizing illegitimate children with the maternal surname repeated. Some Hispanic people, after leaving their country, drop their maternal surname, even if not formally, so as to better fit into the non-Hispanic society they live or work in. Dropping the paternal surname is not unusual when it is a very common one. For instance, painter Pablo Ruiz Picasso and Spanish Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero are known by their maternal surnames as \"Picasso\" and \"Zapatero\". Similarly, Anglophones with just one surname may be asked to provide a second surname on official documents in Spanish-speaking countries. When none (such as the mother's maiden name) is provided, the last name may simply be repeated. Traditionally in most countries, and currently in some Spanish-speaking countries, women, upon marrying, keep their own family names. It is considered impolite towards her family for a woman to change her name. The higher class women of Cuba and Spain traditionally never change their names. In certain rare situations, a woman may be addressed with her paternal surname followed by her husband's paternal surname linked with de . For example, a woman named Ana Garc\u00eda D\u00edaz , upon marrying Juan Guerrero Mac\u00edas , could be called Ana Garc\u00eda de Guerrero . This custom, begun in medieval times, is decaying and only has legal validity [ citation needed ] in Dominican Republic , Ecuador , Guatemala , Nicaragua , Honduras , Peru , Panama , and to a certain extent in Mexico (where it is optional but becoming obsolete), but is frowned upon by people in Spain, Cuba, and elsewhere. In Peru and the Dominican Republic, women normally conserve all family names after getting married. For example, if Rosa Mar\u00eda P\u00e9rez Mart\u00ednez marries Juan Mart\u00edn De la Cruz G\u00f3mez , she will be called Rosa Mar\u00eda P\u00e9rez Mart\u00ednez de De la Cruz , and if the husband dies, she will be called Rosa Mar\u00eda P\u00e9rez Mart\u00ednez Vda. de De la Cruz (Vda. being the abbreviation for viuda , \"widow\" in Spanish). The law in Peru changed some years ago, and all married women can keep their maiden last name if they wish with no alteration. In some churches, such as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, where the family structure is emphasized, as well as legal marriage, the wife is referred to as \" hermana \" [sister] plus the surname of her husband. And most records of the church follow that structure as well. A new trend in the United States for Hispanics is to hyphenate their father's and mother's last names. This is done because American born English-speakers are not aware of the Hispanic custom of using two last names and thus mistake the first last name of the individual for a middle name. In doing so they would, for example, mistakenly refer to Esteban \u00c1lvarez Cobos as Esteban A. Cobos. Such confusion can be particularly troublesome in official matters. To avoid such mistakes, Esteban \u00c1lvarez Cobos, would become Esteban \u00c1lvarez-Cobos, to clarify that both are last names. In Spanish villages in Catalonia, Galicia , and Asturias and in Cuba, people are often known by the name of their dwelling or collective family nickname rather than by their surnames. For example, Remei Pujol i Serra who lives at Ca l'Elvira would be referred to as \"Remei de Ca l'Elvira\"; and Adela Barreira L\u00f3pez who is part of the \"Provisores\" family would be known as \"Adela dos Provisores\". In the case of Cantabria the family's nickname is used instead of the surname: if one family is known as \"\u00d1ecos\" because of an ancestor who was known as \"\u00d1ecu\", they would be \"Jos\u00e9 el de \u00d1ecu\" or \"Ana la de \u00d1ecu\" (collective: the \u00d1eco's). Some common nicknames are \"Rubiu\" (blonde or ginger hair), \"Roju\" (reddish, as referred to ginger hair), \"Chiqui\" (small), \"Jinchu\" (big), and a bunch of names about certain characteristics, family relationship or geographical origin (pasiegu, masoniegu, sobanu, llebaniegu, tresmeranu, pejinu, naveru, merachu, tresneru, troule, mallavia, marotias, llamoso, lipa, \u00f1ecu, tarugu, trapajeru, lich\u00f3n, andar\u00edvel). See also: Surnames by country \u00a7\u00a0The Philippines Portuguese-speaking countries [ edit ] Main article: Portuguese name In the case of Portuguese naming customs, the main surname (the one used in alphasorting, indexing, abbreviations, and greetings), appears last. Each person usually has two family names: though the law specifies no order, the first one is usually the maternal family name, whereas the last one is commonly the paternal family name. In Portugal, a person's full name has a minimum legal length of two names (one given name and one family name from either parent) and a maximum of six names (two first names and four surnames \u2014 he or she may have up to four surnames in any order desired picked up from the total of his/her parents and grandparents' surnames). The use of any surname outside this lot, or of more than six names, is legally possible, but it requires dealing with bureaucracy. Parents or the person him/herself must explain the claims they have to bearing that surname (a family nickname, a rare surname lost in past generations, or any other reason one may find suitable). In Brazil there is no limit of surnames used. In general, the traditions followed in countries like Brazil , Portugal and Angola are somewhat different from the ones in Spain. In the Spanish tradition, usually the father's surname comes first, followed by the mother's surname, whereas in Portuguese-speaking countries the father's name is the last, mother's coming first. A woman may adopt her husband's surname(s), but nevertheless she usually keeps her birth names, or at least the last one. Since 1977, a husband can also adopt his wife's surname. When this happens, usually both spouses change their name after marriage. The custom of a woman changing her name upon marriage is recent. It spread in the late 19th century in the upper classes, under French influence, and in the 20th century, particularly during the 1930s and 1940, it became socially almost obligatory. Nowadays, fewer women adopt, even officially, their husbands' names, and among those who do so officially, it is quite common not to use it either in their professional or informal life. [ citation needed ] For the children, some bear only the last surnames of the parents. For example, Carlos da Silva Gon\u00e7alves and Ana Lu\u00edsa de Albuquerque Pereira (Gon\u00e7alves) (in case she adopted her husband's name after marriage) would have a child named Lucas Pereira Gon\u00e7alves . However, the child may have any other combination of the parents' surnames, according to euphony , social significance or other reasons. In ancient times a patronymic was commonly used \u2014 surnames like Gon\u00e7alves (\"son of Gon\u00e7alo \"), Fernandes (\"son of Fernando \"), Nunes (\"son of Nuno \"), Soares (\"son of Soeiro \"), Sanches (\"son of Sancho \"), Henriques (\"son of Henrique \"), Rodrigues (\"son of Rodrigo \") which along with many others are still in regular use as very prevalent family names. In Medieval times, Portuguese nobility started to use one of their estates' names or the name of the town or village they ruled as their surname, just after their patronymic. Soeiro Mendes da Maia bore a name \"Soeiro\", a patronymic \"Mendes\" (\"son of Hermenegildo \u2013 shortened to Mendo\") and the name of the town he ruled \" Maia \". He was often referred to in 12th century documents as \"Soeiro Mendes, senhor da Maia\", Soeiro Mendes, lord of Maia. Noblewomen also bore patronymics and surnames in the same manner and never bore their husband's surname. First-born males bore their father's surname, other children bore either both or only one of them at their will. Only during the Early Modern Age, lower-class males started to use at least one surname; married lower-class women usually took up their spouse's surname, since they rarely ever used one beforehand. After the 1755 Lisbon earthquake , Portuguese authorities realized the benefits of enforcing the use and registry of surnames. Henceforth, they became mandatory, although the rules for their use were very liberal. Until the end of the 19th century it was common for women, especially those from a very poor background, not to have a surname and so to be known only by their first names. A woman would then adopt her husband's full surname after marriage. With the advent of republicanism in Brazil and Portugal, along with the institution of civil registries, all children now have surnames. During the mid-20th century, under French influence and among upper classes, women started to take up their husbands' surname(s). From the 1960s onwards, this usage spread to the common people, again under French influence, this time, however, due to the forceful legal adoption of their husbands' surname which was imposed onto Portuguese immigrant women in France. From the 1974 Carnation Revolution onwards the adoption of their husbands' surname(s) receded again, and today both the adoption and non-adoption occur, with non-adoption being chosen in the majority of cases in recent years (60%). [45] Also, it is legally possible for the husband to adopt his wife's surname(s), but this practice is rare. Brazilians usually call people only by their given names, omitting family names, even in many formal situations, as in the press referring to authorities, e.g. \"Former President Fernando Henrique\", never Former President Cardoso, or even \"Former President Lula\" (\"Lula\" is actually his nickname ). When formality or a prefix requires a family name, the given name usually precedes the surname, e.g. Jo\u00e3o Santos , or Sr. Jo\u00e3o Santos . Common surnames by ethnic group [ edit ] Assyrian [ edit ] This section does not cite any sources . Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . (October 2017) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) The Assyrian people are a distinct ethnic group, descendant largely from the population of ancient Assyria , indigenous to Mesopotamia with roots in the Middle East, mainly present-day Iraq , northwest Iran , northeast Syria and southeast Turkey . Surnames come from the Akkadian influenced Eastern Aramaic dialects of the Assyrian ( Chaldo-Assyrian ) people. Some surnames are connected to East Syrian Rite Christianity , the religion Assyrians currently follow and have followed since the 1st century AD, with others being of distinctly ancient Assyrian/Mesopotamian origin. Common surnames include: Aboona , Abraham , Abro , Agajan , Agassi , Aghase , Akkad , Akbalit/Akbalut , Alamasha , Alawerdy , Aldawid , Amo Baba , Amu , Antar , Aprim , Apshu , Afarcan , Arad , Ashai , Ashouri , Ashurian , Ashur , Awdishu , Awikam , Awishalim , Awitor , Awia , Awrohum , Aziz , Azzo , Baba , Bacchus , Badel , Barkha/Barkho , Brikha , Bronit , Balou , Barkoo , Benassi , Benyamin , Bidavid , Bidawid , Bishu , Cabani , Dadashu/Dadasho , Darmu , Dinkha , Daoud , Dayan/Daian , Disho , Duman , Elia , Elias , Enwia , Eshai , Farhad , Gorges/Georgis , Gewargis , Hadad/Adad , Hamsho , Hasso , Harshu , Hormis , Hosanna , Hurmis , Ilshu , Ilishu , Ishmael , Ishai , Isaac , Ishaq , Iskhaq , Iwassi , Jabri , Jelu , Jendo , Juna , Kambar , Karam , Karoukian , Kasri , Khamo , Khanbaba , Khanisho/Khnanisu , Khnaninia , Khedroo , Khoshanu , Khoshaba , Malech , Malek , Malka , Malkai , Malick , Mamendo , Matti , Merza , Mikhael/Mikhail , Mnashi , Nisan , Nimrod , Narsai , Ninweh , Nineveh , Nessar , Odah , Odisha , Odisho , Oraham , Oshana , Qateneh , Raaba , Rabi , Rafael , Ramsin/Rumsin , Rassam , Rifkha , Ronay , Samo , Sargis , Sargon , Sarkis , Sarmas , Sayad , Semma , Shabad , Shamash/Shamasha , Shamshi , Sinharib , Sharrukin , Shimun , Shamoon , Shimon , Shimonaya , Shinu , Shinai , Sleman , Shulman , Sliwoo/Sliwa , Tematheus , Thoma , Thomaya , Tamraz , Tiras , Tiyareh/Tyareh , Urshan , Warda , Warad , Yacoub , Yawalaha , Yalda , Yatrin , Yetron , Yelu , Yoel , Yohannan , Yonan , Yonadam Yoseph , Yoshu , Youkhana , Younan , Yousif , Yukhannan , Zakharia , Zilkha , Zimri . Circassians [ edit ] This section does not cite any sources . Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . (October 2017) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) In the case of Circassians , especially Adyges and Kabardians , hereditary surnames have been borne by people for many years. Most surnames of Adyge origin fall into six types: Occupations (e.g., 'smith', 'hunter', 'tailor') Personal characteristics (e.g., 'short', 'deaf', 'beautiful') Geographical features (e.g., 'hill', 'river', 'cave', 'wood', 'fields') Animal names (e.g., 'bear', 'horse', 'snake', 'fox', 'wild boar') Patronymics and ancestry, often from a male's given name ('son of...') or from an ethnic name (e.g., Shapsug , Kabardey ) Religious names (e.g., Shogen 'Priest', Yefendi 'Efendi', Mole 'Mullah') Shogen comes from the Christian era, and Yefendi and Mole come from the Muslim era. Circassian women, even when they marry, do not change their surnames. By keeping their surnames and passing it on to the next generation, children come to distinguish relatives from the maternal side and respect her family as well as those from their father's side. On the other hand, children cannot marry someone who bears the same surname as they do, no matter how distantly related. In the Circassian tradition, the formula for surnames is patterned to mean \"daughter of ...\" Abkhaz families follow similar naming patterns reflecting the common roots of the Abkhazian, Adygean and Wubikh peoples. Circassian family names cannot be derived from women's names or from the name of female ancestors. Jewish [ edit ] Main article: Jewish name Jewish names have historically varied, encompassing throughout the centuries several different traditions. The most usual last name for those of the priest tribe is \"Cohen\"/\"Kahen\"/\"Kogan\"/\"Kohen\"/\"Katz\" (a Hebrew acronym of Kohen Tzedek, or righteous Kohen) and for those of the Levites , \"Levi\"/\"Levine\". Those who came from Central or Eastern Europe usually have \"Rosen\"(\"rose\"), \"Spiel\", \"Gold\", and other German words as their names' prefixes, and \"man\", \"wyn\"/\"wein\"(\"wine\"), \"berg\"(\"mountain\"), and other German words as their names' suffixes. Many Sephardic Jews adopted Spanish or Arabic names, like \u201cToledo\u201d, \u201cBejarano\u201d, \"Azizi\" (\"you're [someones] love\"), \" Hassan \" or added words to their original names, Beizaee( \"Iza\", God is perfection), like \"Kohenzadeh\" (\"[she] bore a Kohen\"). Names like \"Johnson\" and \"Peterson\" may be used in Jewish tradition as they too used the father's name as identification. So \"Johnson\" in Hebrew is \"Ben Yochanon\", meaning \"Yochanon (John)'s son\". Many Yemenite Jews' family names are consisting of the place in which their ancestors have come to Yemen (like Sana'a ) and an \"i\" in the end (like the family name \"San'ani\"), indicating belonging to the place they have originated from. Kurdish [ edit ] This section does not cite any sources . Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . (October 2017) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) The majority of Kurds do not hold Kurdish names because the names have been banned in the countries they primarily live in (namely Iran, Turkey and Syria). Kurds in these respective countries tend to hold Turkish, Persian or Arabic names, in the majority of cases, forcefully appointed by the ruling governments. [46] Others hold Arabic names as a result of the influence of Islam and Arab culture. Kurds holding authentic Kurdish names are generally found in Diaspora or in Iraqi Kurdistan where Kurds are relatively free. Traditionally, Kurdish family names are inherited from the tribes of which the individual or families are members. However, some families inherit the names of the regions they are from. Common affixes of authentic Kurdish names are \"-\u00ee\" and \"-za\" also \"-a\" and \"-\u00ea\" by two surnames. e.g.: Name+1Surname+2Surname Male: Baran(\u00ea) Mem\u00ea Alan Baran of Mem of Alan Female: Berf\u00een(a) Soreya Ev\u00een\u00ea Berfin of Sarah of Evin there are also names with the word \"Mal(a)\" [House (of)] e.g.: Baran mala Alan Baran of House of Alan Berf\u00een mala Ev\u00een Berfin of House of Evin Some common Kurdish last names, which are also the names of their respective tribes, include Baradost, Barzani, Berwari, Berzinji, Chelki, Diri, Doski, Jaf, Mutki, Rami, Rekani, Rozaki, Sindi, and Tovi. Other names include Akreyi, Alan, Amedi, Botani, Hewrami, Mukri, and Serhati. Traditionally, Kurdish women did not inherit a man's last name. Although still not in practice by many Kurds, this can be more commonly found today. Tibet [ edit ] Tibetan people are often named at birth by the local Buddhist Lama or they may request a name from the Dalai Lama. The majority do not have family names. They may change their name throughout life if advised by a Buddhist Lama, for example if a different name removes obstacles. Tibetans who enter monastic life take a name from their ordination Lama, which will be a combination of the Lama's name and a new name for them.

(February 2018) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) Inheritance of Dwarfing in Maize. Demonstrating the heights of plants from the two parent variations and their F1 heterozygous hybrid (centre). Dominance in genetics is a relationship between alleles of one gene , in which the effect on phenotype of one allele masks the contribution of a second allele at the same locus . [1] [2] The first allele is dominant and the second allele is recessive . For genes on an autosome (any chromosome other than a sex chromosome ), the alleles and their associated traits are autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive . Dominance is a key concept in Mendelian inheritance and classical genetics . Often the dominant allele codes for a functional protein whereas the recessive allele does not. A classic example of dominance is the inheritance of seed shape in peas . Peas may be round, associated with allele R or wrinkled, associated with allele r . In this case, three combinations of alleles (genotypes) are possible: RR , Rr , and rr . The RR individuals have round peas and the rr individuals have wrinkled peas. In Rr individuals the R allele masks the presence of the r allele, so these individuals also have round peas. Thus, allele R is dominant to allele r , and allele r is recessive to allele R . This use of upper case letters for dominant alleles and lower case ones for recessive alleles is a widely followed convention. More generally, where a gene exists in two allelic versions (designated A and a ), three combinations of alleles are possible: AA , Aa , and aa . If AA and aa individuals ( homozygotes ) show different forms of some trait (phenotypes), and Aa individuals (heterozygotes) show the same phenotype as AA individuals, then allele A is said to dominate , be dominant to or show dominance to allele a , and a is said to be recessive to A . Dominance is not inherent to either an allele or its phenotype. It is a relationship between two alleles of a gene and their associated phenotypes; one allele can be dominant over a second allele, recessive to a third allele, and codominant to a fourth. Also, an allele may be dominant for a particular aspect of phenotype but not for other aspects influenced by the same gene. Dominance differs from epistasis , a relationship in which an allele of one gene affects the expression of another allele at a different gene.

Though Mendel, \"The Father of Genetics\", first used the term in the 1860s, it was not widely known until the early twentieth century. Mendel observed that, for a variety of traits of garden peas having to do with the appearance of seeds, seed pods, and plants, there were two discrete phenotypes, such as round versus wrinkled seeds, yellow versus green seeds, red versus white flowers or tall versus short plants. When bred separately, the plants always produced the same phenotypes, generation after generation. However, when lines with different phenotypes were crossed (interbred), one and only one of the parental phenotypes showed up in the offspring (green, or round, or red, or tall). However, when these hybrid plants were crossed, the offspring plants showed the two original phenotypes, in a characteristic 3:1 ratio, the more common phenotype being that of the parental hybrid plants. Mendel reasoned that each parent in the first cross was a homozygote for different alleles (one parent AA and the other parent aa), that each contributed one allele to the offspring, with the result that all of these hybrids were heterozygotes (Aa), and that one of the two alleles in the hybrid cross dominated expression of the other: A masked a. The final cross between two heterozygotes (Aa X Aa) would produce AA, Aa, and aa offspring in a 1:2:1 genotype ratio with the first two classes showing the (A) phenotype, and the last showing the (a) phenotype, thereby producing the 3:1 phenotype ratio. Mendel did not use the terms gene, allele, phenotype, genotype, homozygote, and heterozygote, all of which were introduced later. He did introduce the notation of capital and lowercase letters for dominant and recessive alleles, respectively, still in use today. Chromosomes, genes, and alleles [ edit ] See also: Ploidy and Zygosity an autosomal dominant pattern. an autosomal recessive pattern. Most animals and some plants have paired chromosomes , and are described as diploid. They have two versions of each chromosome, one contributed by the mother's ovum , and the other by the father's sperm , known as gametes , described as haploid, and created through meiosis . These gametes then fuse during fertilization during sexual reproduction , into a new single cell zygote , which divides multiple times, resulting in a new organism with the same number of pairs of chromosomes in each (non-gamete) cell as its parents. Each chromosome of a matching (homologous) pair is structurally similar to the other, and has a very similar DNA sequence ( loci , singular locus). The DNA in each chromosome functions as a series of discrete genes that influence various traits. Thus, each gene also has a corresponding homologue, which may exist in different versions called alleles . The alleles at the same locus on the two homologous chromosomes may be identical or different. Blood types in humans is determined by a gene that creates an A, B, AB or O blood type and is located in the long arm of chromosome nine. There are three different alleles that could be present at this locus, but only two can be present in any individual, one inherited from their mother and one from their father. [4] If two alleles of a given gene are identical, the organism is called a homozygote and is said to be homozygous with respect to that gene; if instead the two alleles are different, the organism is a heterozygote and is heterozygous. The genetic makeup of an organism, either at a single locus or over all its genes collectively, is called its genotype . The genotype of an organism directly and indirectly affects its molecular, physical, and other traits, which individually or collectively are called its phenotype . At heterozygous gene loci, the two alleles interact to produce the phenotype. Dominance [ edit ] Complete dominance [ edit ] In complete dominance, the effect of one allele in a heterozygous genotype completely masks the effect of the other. The allele that masks the other is said to be dominant to the latter, and the allele that is masked is said to be recessive to the former. [5] Complete dominance, therefore, means that the phenotype of the heterozygote is indistinguishable from that of the dominant homozygote. A classic example of dominance is the inheritance of seed shape (pea shape) in peas. Peas may be round (associated with allele R ) or wrinkled (associated with allele r ). In this case, three combinations of alleles ( genotypes ) are possible: RR and rr are homozygous and Rr is heterozygous. The RR individuals have round peas and the rr individuals have wrinkled peas. In Rr individuals the R allele masks the presence of the r allele, so these individuals also have round peas. Thus, allele R is completely dominant to allele r , and allele r is recessive to allele R . Incomplete dominance [ edit ] This Punnett square illustrates incomplete dominance. In this example, the red petal trait associated with the R allele recombines with the white petal trait of the r allele. The plant incompletely expresses the dominant trait (R) causing plants with the Rr genotype to express flowers with less red pigment resulting in pink flowers. The colors are not blended together, the dominant trait is just expressed less strongly. Incomplete dominance (also called partial dominance , semi-dominance or intermediate inheritance ) occurs when the phenotype of the heterozygous genotype is distinct from and often intermediate to the phenotypes of the homozygous genotypes. For example, the snapdragon flower color is homozygous for either red or white. When the red homozygous flower is paired with the white homozygous flower, the result yields a pink snapdragon flower. The pink snapdragon is the result of incomplete dominance. A similar type of incomplete dominance is found in the four o'clock plant wherein pink color is produced when true-bred parents of white and red flowers are crossed. In quantitative genetics , where phenotypes are measured and treated numerically, if a heterozygote's phenotype is exactly between (numerically) that of the two homozygotes, the phenotype is said to exhibit no dominance at all, i.e. dominance exists only when the heterozygote's phenotype measure lies closer to one homozygote than the other. When plants of the F 1 generation are self-pollinated, the phenotypic and genotypic ratio of the F 2 generation will be 1:2:1 (Red:Pink:White). [6] See partial dominance hypothesis . Co-dominance [ edit ] Co-dominance in a Camellia cultivar A and B blood types in humans show co-dominance, but the O type is recessive to A and B. This diagram shows co-dominance. In this example a white bull (WW) mates with a red cow (RR), and their offspring exhibit co-dominance expressing both white and red hairs. Co-dominance occurs when the contributions of both alleles are visible in the phenotype. For example, in the ABO blood group system , chemical modifications to a glycoprotein (the H antigen) on the surfaces of blood cells are controlled by three alleles, two of which are co-dominant to each other ( I A , I B ) and dominant over the recessive i at the ABO locus . The I A and I B alleles produce different modifications. The enzyme coded for by I A adds an N-acetylgalactosamine to the membrane-bound H antigen. The I B enzyme adds a galactose. The i allele produces no modification. Thus I A and I B alleles are each dominant to i ( I A I A and I A i individuals both have type A blood, and I B I B and I B i individuals both have type B blood, but I A I B individuals have both modifications on their blood cells and thus have type AB blood, so the I A and I B alleles are said to be co-dominant). Another example occurs at the locus for the Beta-globin component of hemoglobin , where the three molecular phenotypes of Hb A /Hb A , Hb A /Hb S , and Hb S /Hb S are all distinguishable by protein electrophoresis . (The medical condition produced by the heterozygous genotype is called sickle-cell trait and is a milder condition distinguishable from sickle-cell anemia , thus the alleles show incomplete dominance with respect to anemia, see above). For most gene loci at the molecular level, both alleles are expressed co-dominantly, because both are transcribed into RNA . Co-dominance, where allelic products co-exist in the phenotype, is different from incomplete dominance, where the quantitative interaction of allele products produces an intermediate phenotype. For example, in co-dominance, a red homozygous flower and a white homozygous flower will produce offspring that have red and white spots. When plants of the F1 generation are self-pollinated, the phenotypic and genotypic ratio of the F2 generation will be 1:2:1 (Red:Spotted:White). These ratios are the same as those for incomplete dominance. Again, note that this classical terminology is inappropriate \u2013 in reality such cases should not be said to exhibit dominance at all. Addressing common misconceptions [ edit ] While it is often convenient to talk about a recessive allele or a dominant trait , dominance is not inherent to either an allele or its phenotype. Dominance is a relationship between two alleles of a gene and their associated phenotypes. A \"dominant\" allele is dominant to a particular allele of the same gene that can be inferred from the context, but it may be recessive to a third allele, and codominant to a fourth. Similarly, a \"recessive\" trait is a trait associated with a particular recessive allele implied by the context, but that same trait may occur in a different context where it is due to some other gene and a dominant allele. Dominance is unrelated to the nature of the phenotype itself, that is, whether it is regarded as \"normal\" or \"abnormal,\" \"standard\" or \"nonstandard,\" \"healthy\" or \"diseased,\" \"stronger\" or \"weaker,\" or more or less extreme. A dominant or recessive allele may account for any of these trait types. Dominance does not determine whether an allele is deleterious, neutral or advantageous. However, selection must operate on genes indirectly through phenotypes, and dominance affects the exposure of alleles in phenotypes, and hence the rate of change in allele frequencies under selection. Deleterious recessive alleles may persist in a population at low frequencies, with most copies carried in heterozygotes, at no cost to those individuals. These rare recessives are the basis for many hereditary genetic disorders . Dominance is also unrelated to the distribution of alleles in the population. Some dominant alleles are extremely common, while others are extremely rare. The most common allele in a population may be recessive when combined with some rare variants. Nomenclature [ edit ] This section is about gene notations that identify dominance. For modern formal nomenclature, see Gene nomenclature . In genetics, symbols began as algebraic placeholders. When one allele is dominant to another, the oldest convention is to symbolize the dominant allele with a capital letter. The recessive allele is assigned the same letter in lower case. In the pea example, once the dominance relationship between the two alleles is known, it is possible to designate the dominant allele that produces a round shape by a capital-letter symbol R , and the recessive allele that produces a wrinkled shape by a lower-case symbol r . The homozygous dominant, heterozygous, and homozygous recessive genotypes are then written RR , Rr , and rr , respectively. It would also be possible to designate the two alleles as W and w , and the three genotypes WW , Ww , and ww , the first two of which produced round peas and the third wrinkled peas. Note that the choice of \" R \" or \" W \" as the symbol for the dominant allele does not pre-judge whether the allele causing the \"round\" or \"wrinkled\" phenotype when homozygous is the dominant one. A gene may have several alleles. Each allele is symbolized by the locus symbol followed by a unique superscript. In many species, the most common allele in the wild population is designated the wild type allele. It is symbolized with a + character as a superscript. Other alleles are dominant or recessive to the wild type allele. For recessive alleles, the locus symbol is in lower case letters. For alleles with any degree of dominance to the wild type allele, the first letter of the locus symbol is in upper case. For example, here are some of the alleles at the a locus of the laboratory mouse, Mus musculus : A y , dominant yellow; a + , wild type; and a bt , black and tan. The a bt allele is recessive to the wild type allele, and the A y allele is codominant to the wild type allele. The A y allele is also codominant to the a bt allele, but showing that relationship is beyond the limits of the rules for mouse genetic nomenclature. Rules of genetic nomenclature have evolved as genetics has become more complex. Committees have standardized the rules for some species, but not for all. Rules for one species may differ somewhat from the rules for a different species. [7] [8] Relationship to other genetic concepts [ edit ] Multiple alleles [ edit ] Main article: Allele \u00a7\u00a0Multiple alleles Although any individual of a diploid organism has at most two different alleles at any one locus (barring aneuploidies ), most genes exist in a large number of allelic versions in the population as a whole. If the alleles have different effects on the phenotype, sometimes their dominance interactions with each other can be described as a series. For example, coat color in domestic cats is affected by a series of alleles of the TYR gene (which encodes the enzyme tyrosinase ). The alleles C , c b , c s , and c a (full colour, Burmese , Siamese , and albino , respectively) produce different levels of pigment and hence different levels of colour dilution. The C allele (full colour) is completely dominant over the last three and the c a allele (albino) is completely recessive to the first three. [9] [10] [11] Autosomal versus sex-linked dominance [ edit ] Main article: Sex linkage In humans and other mammal species, sex is determined by two sex chromosomes called the X chromosome and the Y chromosome . Human females are typically XX ; males are typically XY . The remaining pairs of chromosome are found in both sexes and are called autosomes ; genetic traits due to loci on these chromosomes are described as autosomal, and may be dominant or recessive. Genetic traits on the X and Y chromosomes are called sex-linked, because they are linked to sex chromosomes, not because they are characteristic of one sex or the other. In practice, the term almost always refers to X -linked traits and a great many such traits (such as red-green colour vision deficiency) are not affected by sex. Females have two copies of every gene locus found on the X chromosome, just as for the autosomes, and the same dominance relationships apply. Males however have only one copy of each X chromosome gene locus, and are described as hemizygous for these genes. The Y chromosome is much smaller than the X , and contains a much smaller set of genes, including, but not limited to, those that influence 'maleness', such as the SRY gene for testis determining factor . Dominance rules for sex-linked gene loci are determined by their behavior in the female: because the male has only one allele (except in the case of certain types of Y chromosome aneuploidy ), that allele is always expressed regardless of whether it is dominant or recessive. Epistasis [ edit ] Main article: Epistasis Epistasis [\" epi + stasis = to sit on top\"] is an interaction between alleles at two different gene loci that affect a single trait, which may sometimes resemble a dominance interaction between two different alleles at the same locus. Epistasis modifies the characteristic 9:3:3:1 ratio expected for two non-epistatic genes. For two loci, 14 classes of epistatic interactions are recognized. As an example of recessive epistasis , one gene locus may determine whether a flower pigment is yellow ( AA or Aa ) or green ( aa ), while another locus determines whether the pigment is produced ( BB or Bb ) or not ( bb ). In a bb plant, the flowers will be white, irrespective of the genotype of the other locus as AA , Aa , or aa . The bb combination is not dominant to the A allele: rather, the B gene shows recessive epistasis to the A gene, because the B locus when homozygous for the recessive allele ( bb ) suppresses phenotypic expression of the A locus. In a cross between two AaBb plants, this produces a characteristic 9:3:4 ratio, in this case of yellow\u00a0: green\u00a0: white flowers. In dominant epistasis , one gene locus may determine yellow or green pigment as in the previous example: AA and Aa are yellow, and aa are green. A second locus determines whether a pigment precursor is produced ( dd ) or not ( DD or Dd ). Here, in a DD or Dd plant, the flowers will be colorless irrespective of the genotype at the A locus, because of the epistatic effect of the dominant D allele. Thus, in a cross between two AaDd plants, 3/4 of the plants will be colorless, and the yellow and green phenotypes are expressed only in dd plants. This produces a characteristic 12:3:1 ratio of white\u00a0: yellow\u00a0: green plants. Supplementary epistasis occurs when two loci affect the same phenotype. For example, if pigment color is produced by CC or Cc but not cc , and by DD or Dd but not dd , then pigment is not produced in any genotypic combination with either cc or dd . That is, both loci must have at least one dominant allele to produce the phenotype. This produces a characteristic 9:7 ratio of pigmented to unpigmented plants. Complementary epistasis in contrast produces an unpigmented plant if and only if the genotype is cc and dd , and the characteristic ratio is 15:1 between pigmented and unpigmented plants. [12] Classical genetics considered epistatic interactions between two genes at a time. It is now evident from molecular genetics that all gene loci are involved in complex interactions with many other genes (e.g., metabolic pathways may involve scores of genes), and that this creates epistatic interactions that are much more complex than the classic two-locus models. Hardy-Weinberg principle (estimation of carrier frequency) [ edit ] Main article: Hardy-Weinberg principle The frequency of the heterozygous state (which is the carrier state for a recessive trait) can be estimated using the Hardy-Weinberg formula : p 2 + 2 p q + q 2 = 1 {\\displaystyle p^{2}+2pq+q^{2}=1} This formula applies to a gene with exactly two alleles and relates the frequencies of those alleles in a large population to the frequencies of their three genotypes in that population. For example, if p is the frequency of allele A , and q is the frequency of allele a then the terms p 2 , 2 pq , and q 2 are the frequencies of the genotypes AA , Aa and aa respectively. Since the gene has only two alleles, all alleles must be either A or a and p + q = 1 . Now, if A is completely dominant to a then the frequency of the carrier genotype Aa cannot be directly observed (since it has the same traits as the homozygous genotype AA ), however it can be estimated from the frequency of the recessive trait in the population, since this is the same as that of the homozygous genotype aa . i.e. the individual allele frequencies can be estimated: q = \u221a f (aa) , p = 1 \u2212 q , and from those the frequency of the carrier genotype can be derived: f (Aa) = 2 pq . This formula relies on a number of assumptions and an accurate estimate of the frequency of the recessive trait. In general, any real-world situation will deviate from these assumptions to some degree, introducing corresponding inaccuracies into the estimate. If the recessive trait is rare, then it will be hard to estimate its frequency accurately, as a very large sample size will be needed. Dominant versus advantageous [ edit ] The property of \"dominant\" is sometimes confused with the concept of advantageous and the property of \"recessive\" is sometimes confused with the concept of deleterious, but the phenomena are distinct. Dominance describes the phenotype of heterozygotes with regard to the phenotypes of the homozygotes and without respect to the degree to which different phenotypes may be beneficial or deleterious. Since many genetic disease alleles are recessive and because the word dominance has a positive connotation, the assumption that the dominant phenotype is superior with respect to fitness is often made. This is not assured however; as discussed below while most genetic disease alleles are deleterious and recessive, not all genetic diseases are recessive. Nevertheless, this confusion has been pervasive throughout the history of genetics and persists to this day. Addressing this confusion was one of the prime motivations for the publication of the Hardy-Weinberg principle . Molecular mechanisms [ edit ] The molecular basis of dominance was unknown to Mendel. It is now understood that a gene locus includes a long series (hundreds to thousands) of bases or nucleotides of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) at a particular point on a chromosome. The central dogma of molecular biology states that \" DNA makes RNA makes protein \", that is, that DNA is transcribed to make an RNA copy, and RNA is translated to make a protein. In this process, different alleles at a locus may or may not be transcribed, and if transcribed may be translated to slightly different versions of the same protein (called isoforms ). Proteins often function as enzymes that catalyze chemical reactions in the cell, which directly or indirectly produce phenotypes. In any diploid organism, the DNA sequences of the two alleles present at any gene locus may be identical (homozygous) or different (heterozygous). Even if the gene locus is heterozygous at the level of the DNA sequence, the proteins made by each allele may be identical. In the absence of any difference between the protein products, neither allele can be said to be dominant (see co-dominance , above). Even if the two protein products are slightly different ( allozymes ), it is likely that they produce the same phenotype with respect to enzyme action, and again neither allele can be said to be dominant. Loss of function and haplosufficiency [ edit ] Dominance typically occurs when one of the two alleles is non-functional at the molecular level, that is, it is not transcribed or else does not produce a functional protein product. This can be the result of a mutation that alters the DNA sequence of the allele. [ citation needed ] An organism homozygous for the non-functional allele will generally show a distinctive phenotype, due to the absence of the protein product. For example, in humans and other organisms, the unpigmented skin of the albino phenotype [13] results when an individual is homozygous for an allele that encodes a non-functional version of an enzyme needed to produce the skin pigment melanin . It is important to understand that it is not the lack of function that allows the allele to be described as recessive: this is the interaction with the alternative allele in the heterozygote. Three general types of interaction are possible: In the typical case, the single functional allele makes sufficient protein to produce a phenotype identical to that of the homozygote: this is called haplosufficiency . For example, suppose the standard amount of enzyme produced in the functional homozygote is 100%, with the two functional alleles contributing 50% each. The single functional allele in the heterozygote produces 50% of the standard amount of enzyme, which is sufficient to produce the standard phenotype. If the heterozygote and the functional-allele homozygote have identical phenotypes, the functional allele is dominant to the non-functional allele. This occurs at the albino gene locus: the heterozygote produces sufficient enzyme to convert the pigment precursor to melanin, and the individual has standard pigmentation. Less commonly, the presence of a single functional allele gives a phenotype that is not normal but less severe than that of the non-functional homozygote. This occurs when the functional allele is not haplo-sufficient. The terms haplo-insufficiency and incomplete dominance are typically applied to these cases. The intermediate interaction occurs where the heterozygous genotype produces a phenotype intermediate between the two homozygotes. Depending on which of the two homozygotes the heterozygote most resembles, one allele is said to show incomplete dominance over the other. For example, in humans the Hb gene locus is responsible for the Beta-chain protein ( HBB ) that is one of the two globin proteins that make up the blood pigment hemoglobin [13] Many people are homozygous for an allele called Hb A ; some persons carry an alternative allele called Hb S , either as homozygotes or heterozygotes. The hemoglobin molecules of Hb S / Hb S homozygotes undergo a change in shape that distorts the morphology of the red blood cells , and causes a severe, life-threatening form of anemia called sickle-cell anemia . Persons heterozygous Hb A / Hb S for this allele have a much less severe form of anemia called sickle-cell trait . Because the disease phenotype of Hb A / Hb S heterozygotes is more similar to but not identical to the Hb A / Hb A homozygote, the Hb A allele is said to be incompletely dominant to the Hb S allele. Rarely, a single functional allele in the heterozygote may produce insufficient gene product for any function of the gene, and the phenotype resembles that of the homozygote for the non-functional allele. This complete haploinsufficiency is very unusual. In these cases the non-functional allele would be said to be dominant to the functional allele. This situation may occur when the non-functional allele produces a defective protein that interferes with the proper function of the protein produced by the standard allele. The presence of the defective protein \"dominates\" the standard protein, and the disease phenotype of the heterozygote more closely resembles that of the homozygote for two defective alleles. Note that the term dominant is often incorrectly applied to defective alleles whose homozygous phenotype has not been examined, but which cause a distinct phenotype when heterozygous with the normal allele. This phenomenon occurs in a number of trinucleotide repeat diseases: for an example and more details see Huntington Disease . [14] Dominant-negative mutations [ edit ] Many proteins are normally active in the form of a multimer, an aggregate of multiple copies of the same protein, otherwise known as a homomultimeric protein or homooligomeric protein . In fact, a majority of the 83,000 different enzymes from 9800 different organisms in the BRENDA Enzyme Database [15] represent homooligomers. [16] When the wild-type version of the protein is present along with a mutant version, a mixed multimer can be formed. A mutation that leads to a mutant protein that disrupts the activity of the wild-type protein in the multimer is a dominant-negative mutation. A dominant-negative mutation may arise in a human somatic cell and provide a proliferative advantage to the mutant cell, leading to its clonal expansion. For instance, a dominant-negative mutation in a gene necessary for the normal process of programmed cell death ( Apoptosis ) in response to DNA damage can make the cell resistant to apoptosis. This will allow proliferation of the clone even when excessive DNA damage is present. Such dominant-negative mutations occur in the tumor suppressor gene p53 . [17] [18] The P53 wild-type protein is normally present as a four-protein multimer (oligotetramer). Dominant-negative p53 mutations occur in a number of different types of cancer and pre-cancerous lesions (e.g. brain tumors, breast cancer, oral pre-cancerous lesions and oral cancer). [17] Dominant-negative mutations also occur in other tumor suppressor genes. For instance two dominant-negative germ line mutations were identified in the Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene which increases susceptibility to breast cancer. [19] Dominant negative mutations of the transcription factor C/EBP\u03b1 can cause acute myeloid leukemia. [20] Inherited dominant negative mutations can also increase the risk of diseases other than cancer. Dominant-negative mutations in Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3) are associated with severe insulin resistance, diabetes mellitus and hypertension. [21] Dominant-negative mutations have also been described in organisms other than humans. In fact, the first study reporting a mutant protein inhibiting the normal function of a wild-type protein in a mixed multimer was with the bacteriophage T4 tail fiber protein GP37. [22] Mutations that produce a truncated protein rather than a full-length mutant protein seem to have the strongest dominant-negative effect in the studies of P53, ATM, C/EBP\u03b1, and bacteriophage T4 GP37. Dominant and recessive genetic diseases in humans [ edit ] In humans, many genetic traits or diseases are classified simply as \"dominant\" or \"recessive\". Especially with so-called recessive diseases, which are indeed a factor of recessive genes, but can oversimplify the underlying molecular basis and lead to misunderstanding of the nature of dominance. For example, the recessive genetic disease phenylketonuria (PKU) [23] results from any of a large number (>60) of alleles at the gene locus for the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ). [24] Many of these alleles produce little or no PAH , as a result of which the substrate phenylalanine (Phe) and its metabolic byproducts accumulate in the central nervous system and can cause severe intellectual disability if untreated. The genotypes and phenotypic consequences of interactions among three alleles are shown in the following table: [25] Genotype PAH activity [ Phe ] conc PKU\u00a0? AA 100% 60 uM No AB 30% 120 uM No CC 5% 200 ~ 300 uM Hyperphenylalaninemia BB 0.3% 600 ~ 2400 uM Yes In unaffected persons homozygous for a standard functional allele ( AA ), PAH activity is standard (100%), and the concentration of phenylalanine in the blood [ Phe ] is about 60 uM. In untreated persons homozygous for one of the PKU alleles ( BB ), PAH activity is close to zero, [Phe] ten to forty times standard, and the individual manifests PKU. In the AB heterozygote, PAH activity is only 30% (not 50%) of standard, blood [ Phe ] is elevated two-fold, and the person does not manifest PKU. Thus, the A allele is dominant to the B allele with respect to PKU, but the B allele is incompletely dominant to the A allele with respect to its molecular effect, determination of PAH activity level (0.3% < 30% << 100%). Finally, the A allele is an incomplete dominant to B with respect to [Phe], as 60 uM < 120 uM << 600 uM. Note once more that it is irrelevant to the question of dominance that the recessive allele produces a more extreme [Phe] phenotype. For a third allele C , a CC homozygote produces a very small amount of PAH enzyme, which results in a somewhat elevated level of [ Phe ] in the blood, a condition called hyperphenylalaninemia , which does not result in intellectual disability. That is, the dominance relationships of any two alleles may vary according to which aspect of the phenotype is under consideration. It is typically more useful to talk about the phenotypic consequences of the allelic interactions involved in any genotype, rather than to try to force them into dominant and recessive categories.

{"question": "i got the joy joy joy down in my heart lyrics", "answer": "", "context": "I've Got the Joy Joy Joy Joy - Wikipedia I've Got the Joy Joy Joy Joy From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search \" Down In My Heart ,\" sometimes titled \" I've Got the Joy \" is a popular Christian song often sung around the campfire and during scouting events. It is often included in Gospel music and a cappella concerts and songbooks. The song was written by George Willis Cooke (23 April 1848 - 30 April 1923). The date of authorship is as yet unknown. [ original research? ] Cooke was born in Comstock, Michigan. He was a Unitarian minister, writer, and editor and is well known for his landmark history of the Unitarian movement in the 19th century. Though largely self-taught, he studied at Meadeville Theological School in 1872. He was ordained in June of that year, not having obtained a degree from the school. He served the parish ministry for 28 years, while writing and editing. He left the ministry in 1900 to pursue scholarship and lecturing. He authored more than 20 books on a wide range of subjects. Contents [ hide ] 1 Lyrics 2 In popular culture 3 References 4 External links Lyrics [ edit ] There are many possible lyrics. The most common opening lyric and chorus is as follows: I've got the joy, joy, joy, joy Down in my heart (Where?) Down in my heart (Where?) Down in my heart I've got the joy, joy, joy, joy Down in my heart Down in my heart to stay And I'm so happy So very happy I have the love of Jesus in my heart (down in my heart) And I'm so happy So very happy I have the love of Jesus in my heart Subsequent lyrics include: I've got the peace that passes understanding down in my heart... I've got the far out faith that freaks out the farmers down in my heart... I've got the glorious hope of my blessed redeemer way down in the depths of my heart... I've got the mighty Messiah that manifests miracles down in the depths of my heart... I've got the beautiful blessing that baffles the Buddhists down in the depths of my heart... I've got the Christian confession that confuses the Communists down in the depths of my heart... I've got the far out feeling that freaks out the Pharisees down in the depths of my heart... I've got the love of Jesus Christ my savior down in my heart... I've got the wonderful love of my blessed redeemer way down in the depths of my heart... And if the devil doesn't like it he can sit on a tack, ouch, sit on a tack, ouch, sit on a tack. And if the devil doesn't like it he can sit on a tack. Sit on a tack to stay. I've got the brightest light in the depths of my heart... I've got the infinite love of the living lord down in the depths of my heart... I've got the love of Jesus, love of Jesus down in my heart... I've got that opposition to conscription down in my heart... [1] In popular culture [ edit ] Origin of the title of William Stafford 's prose memoir of his WWII pacifist service, Down In My Heart. [2] NRBQ's version of the song is played in the final moments of FX's American television series \" Wilfred \". Though the context it's played in is not conducive to the songs original theme of Christianity, instead referring to the main characters coming to peace with his state of mind, it is possibly for this reason that only the chorus of the song is played. This is the gospel song Granny (actress Irene Ryan ) sings in an episode of the 1960s TV sitcom, \" The Beverly Hillbillies \" Sung by The Simpsons characters Rod and Todd in episode 410 ( Lisa's First Word ) originally aired 3 December 1993. Included by The Housemartins as one of the tracks on the London 0 Hull 4 Deluxe Edition album, from when lead singer Paul Heaton 's lyrics reflected his Christian views at the time. The song is sung by Jeremy Sumpter and Matt O'Leary at the beginning of the 2001 thriller Frailty . Used in Coca-Cola ad April, 2015. In the 2014 Game LISA, the song is repeatedly sung by the character Buzzo when offering the in-game drug, Joy. In 2015, S7E7 of Tosh.0 featured Daniel Tosh referencing and singing it. In 2016, VolksWagen used the song in a TV commercial aired during the UEFA Euro 2016. In 2017, it is sung in the first episode of Sun Records .

[2] Las Vegas is also home to two minor league sports teams: the Las Vegas 51s of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League ( Minor League Baseball ) and the Las Vegas Lights FC of the United Soccer League , one of two leagues that collectively make up the second level of the U.S. men's soccer league system . Both teams are currently the only teams to actually play in the city of Las Vegas, playing at the city owned Cashman Field . The University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), located just off the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise , fields National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I athletic teams. Sam Boyd Stadium , located in Whitney , hosts UNLV football ; the Las Vegas Bowl , an annual NCAA bowl game ; and the USA Sevens , the largest rugby tournament in North America. [3] The Las Vegas Motor Speedway (LVMS) just north of the city hosts NASCAR 's Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series and other automotive events. The National Finals Rodeo is held annually at the Thomas & Mack Center on the UNLV campus, and the Professional Bull Riders holds its annual World Finals at T-Mobile Arena on the Strip. Visitors and residents also have many options for boating , golf , hiking , rock climbing . The city has many parks which offer a wide range of activities.

Due in part to perceived risks with legal sports betting, no major professional sports league had ever had a team in Las Vegas until the NHL decision to expand there came in June 2016, though the NBA's Utah Jazz played 11 home games at the Thomas & Mack Center in the 1983\u201384 season . [4] The placement of a major league team in Las Vegas was an ongoing topic of discussion between city leaders and the professional sports leagues. Past issues with major league sports [ edit ] Professional sports leagues historically avoided Las Vegas due to legal sports betting. Historically, the most prominent issue was the perceived problem of legal sports betting . Traditionally, all four major professional sports leagues had strong anti-gambling policies, prohibiting their personnel from having any involvement in gambling. The NFL took the toughest stance, even refusing to accept Las Vegas tourism advertising for Super Bowl telecasts [5] and threatening to file suit against any local hotels holding Super Bowl parties. [6] Hotels got around the legal threat by referring to the Super Bowl as \"The Big Game\" rather than its actual name in advertising. [6] In addition, some potential owners believed a professional sports franchise would have difficulty gaining an audience, given Las Vegas's numerous entertainment options. A number of prior professional football teams in the city ranked at or near last in their leagues in attendance over the years, such as the Las Vegas Posse , Las Vegas Locomotives and arena football Las Vegas Outlaws . Las Vegas also has a high percentage of residents working in 24-hour occupations, many of whom work nights and weekends when most games would be played. Several owners of other sports franchises disagreed. Miami Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria described Las Vegas as \"a potential gold mine\" for a professional sports team owner. Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban was also quoted as saying that Las Vegas would be a good professional sports town. As the four leagues embraced daily fantasy sports (DFS) and mobile sports betting became more prevalent the perceptions that the four major professional sports leagues had of Las Vegas changed and the doors opened to major pro sports in the market. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said he was in favor of regulated, legalized sports gambling and later the NHL became the first of the four professional sports leagues to land in Vegas, with the expansion team Vegas Golden Knights debuting in October 2017. The NFL, once a staunch opponent of Las Vegas, became the second of the four leagues to come to Vegas with the relocation of the Oakland Raiders to the area by 2020. Prior to the opening of T-Mobile Arena in April 2016, another major obstacle was the lack of suitable facilities. The city did not have a facility that was large enough or modern enough to host an MLB or NFL team. While the Thomas & Mack Center and MGM Grand Garden Arena were large enough on paper to host an NBA or NHL team, they were not suitable for anything beyond temporary use due to age and/or design issues. Harrah's Entertainment and the Anschutz Entertainment Group committed to building a new arena on a parcel of land behind Harrah's Paris and Bally's off the Strip , to be built to NHL and NBA standards. The arena was expected to open in the fall of 2010, but construction never began. Harrah's Entertainment CEO Gary Loveman said in a June, 2009 article in Las Vegas Business Press that his company was still committed to building the arena, but it was delayed by a lack of financing. On April 6, 2010 the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that three proposals had been made to build an arena of approximately 20,000 seats on or near the Strip to host professional basketball and hockey, rodeo, concerts and other events. All three proposals called for public money to be used for a portion of the construction cost. [7] On November 5, 2013, Las Vegas news media reported plans for a joint-venture arena to be built on the Strip with the backing parties being AEG and MGM Resorts . Located at a former parking lot at the back of the Monte Carlo , T-Mobile Arena seats 20,000 and costs $350 million. Ground was broken on May 2014, with its opening on April 6, 2016. [8] [9] Cashman Field is planned to be replaced for baseball by Las Vegas Ballpark in Summerlin by 2019. Sam Boyd Stadium is scheduled to be replaced with Las Vegas Stadium which will be the home of the Las Vegas Raiders and UNLV Football beginning in 2020. Ground was broken for Las Vegas Stadium on November 13, 2017. [10] Major league professional teams [ edit ] National Hockey League [ edit ] T-Mobile Arena , home of the Vegas Golden Knights Las Vegas is the home to the Vegas Golden Knights of the National Hockey League (NHL). The Golden Knights are owned by Black Knight Sports & Entertainment, a consortium led by Bill Foley , [1] and play at T-Mobile Arena . The Golden Knights began play during the 2017\u201318 NHL season and became the first major league professional team in Las Vegas. Prior to the Golden Knights, the National Hockey League had experience with Las Vegas beginning in 1991, when an outdoor game was held in Las Vegas, with the Los Angeles Kings facing the New York Rangers outside Caesars Palace in a preseason exhibition game. It carried thorough the years with an annual preseason exhibition game called Frozen Fury which was held at the MGM Grand Garden Arena . [11] The league has also held the NHL Awards ceremonies after each season since 2009. [12] National Football League [ edit ] See also: Oakland Raiders relocation to Las Vegas Aerial view of the site of Las Vegas Stadium (center left), the future home of the Las Vegas Raiders and UNLV Rebels . It is expected to be completed for the 2020 NFL season. Las Vegas will be home to the Las Vegas Raiders of the National Football League (NFL) possibly beginning as soon as after the 2018 NFL season .  On March 27, 2017, NFL owners voted 31\u20131 to approve the Oakland Raiders ' move to Las Vegas, who will continue to play at the Oakland\u2013Alameda County Coliseum in Oakland in 2017 and possibly longer, [13] until their new stadium, the Las Vegas Stadium , is built in time for the 2020 NFL season. Prior to the Raiders approved relocation to Las Vegas, professional outdoor football had been attempted three times in the area. The first two attempts, the XFL 's Las Vegas Outlaws and the Canadian Football League 's Las Vegas Posse , were unsuccessful, with both teams folding after only one season of play. The XFL folded outright, while the Posse were a failure at the box office, part of the CFL 's failed U.S. expansion attempt . A third attempt at professional football was begun in the fall of 2009 with the United Football League 's Las Vegas Locomotives ; however, the franchise and the league folded in 2012. The Locomotives played in the league's first three championship games, winning the first two in 2009 and 2010. Women's National Basketball Association [ edit ] In October 2017, multiple national media outlets reported that Spurs Sports & Entertainment , owner of the San Antonio Spurs of the National Basketball Association (NBA) and its Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) sister team, the San Antonio Stars , had reached an agreement to sell the Stars to a Las Vegas-based group that would move the team to the area effective with the 2018 season. The NBA and WNBA officially approved the sale on October 17, 2017 and announced the Las Vegas Aces will be playing at the Mandalay Bay Events Center starting in the 2018 season. [14] Proposed major league teams [ edit ] Major League Baseball [ edit ] In April 2004, Major League Baseball (MLB) Commissioner Bud Selig publicly revealed that baseball was considering Las Vegas as a potential home for the Montreal Expos . The lack of a baseball park that could be quickly reconfigured for Major League Baseball cost the city any chance of landing the team. Baseball eventually chose Washington, D.C., primarily because the city agreed to provide a new stadium built entirely with public funding. [15] A news item on a local television station dated August 26, 2010 reported that then Mayor Oscar Goodman was still actively pursuing a Major League Baseball franchise for the city. He was reportedly rebuffed by the owner of an unnamed team due to the small size of the market and the weak local economy. [16] National Basketball Association [ edit ] Rumors surfaced in 2005 about the possible relocation of the National Basketball Association 's (NBA) Sacramento Kings to Las Vegas. In November 2006, California voters rejected a proposal to fund a new arena in Sacramento, considered to be a condition of the team remaining there. Another possible factor was that the owners of the Kings, the Maloof family , also owned the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas. Changes in the Kings owners' financial situation led to a decision to sell the club to a group planning to keep the team in Sacramento, which finalized the purchase of the Kings in May 2013. [17] [18] The Milwaukee Bucks had also been mentioned as possible candidates for relocation to Las Vegas, as were the Seattle SuperSonics before their relocation to Oklahoma City . [19] [20] Former UNLV and NBA player Jackie Robinson was working to build the All Net Resort and Arena , a $1.4 billion privately funded complex encompassing an arena, hotel and shopping project near the SLS Las Vegas and Turnberry Towers that could attract an NBA franchise to Las Vegas. The arena itself would cost $670 million, being operated by Comcast-Spectacor (owners of another NBA stadium, Philadelphia's Wells Fargo Center ). [21] Designed by the Cuningham Group, the arena was planned to open in 2017. [22] The All Net Arena saw its groundbreaking ceremony on October 29, 2014, [23] and Robinson entered into negotiations with Clark County expecting to begin construction by Fall 2015. [24] However, the plan was placed on hold in 2016, presumably due to the progress made on T-Mobile Arena. Las Vegas hosted the 2007 NBA All-Star Game , the only time the event has been held in a non-NBA city. [25] As part of the conditions the NBA set for holding the game in Las Vegas, sports books agreed not to take bets on the game. The NBA Summer League is currently held in Paradise, Nevada. The 2008 and 2012 United States men's Olympic basketball teams trained in Las Vegas, and played a game at the Thomas & Mack Center against the Dominican Republic . In October 2016, during an interview with KNPR\u2019s State of Nevada, MGM Resorts International CEO Jim Murren said he's working on bringing an NBA team to Las Vegas, to play at the T-Mobile Arena. \"It wouldn\u2019t be an expansion team,\u201d Murren said. \u201cIt would most likely be the relocation of an existing team.\u201d [26] Major League Soccer [ edit ] The local media reported in the summer of 2008 that Las Vegas was on the short list of cities Major League Soccer (MLS) was considering for an expansion franchise in the near future.  After a controversial campaign by Mayor Carolyn Goodman and Cordish Company to use public dollars for a new taxpayer-funded stadium, the proposal faced public backlash before MLS ultimately decided to pass on Las Vegas in February 2015. [27] [28] Minor league professional teams [ edit ] Baseball [ edit ] Las Vegas 51s baseball game at Cashman Field Las Vegas is home to the Las Vegas 51s of the Pacific Coast League (AAA) who play at Cashman Field . The 51's are currently the AAA affiliate of the New York Mets and the only professional team that plays in the City of Las Vegas. On October 11, 2017, the Las Vegas 51s got approval to build Las Vegas Ballpark in Summerlin, Nevada. However, the Mets also announced the end of their affiliation with the Las Vegas 51s effective after the 2018 season. Soccer [ edit ] Beginning in 2018, Las Vegas became home to a USL soccer team known as the Las Vegas Lights FC . The team shares Cashman Field with the baseball 51s and is the second team to play within the Las Vegas city limits. Minor League sports issues [ edit ] Since Cashman Field (the only sports facility the city owns) opened in 1983, all but three other cities in AAA baseball (Pawtucket, Tacoma and Portland) have opened new ballparks. [29] Little has been done to improve Cashman since it opened. After the toilets backed up during a 2015 game, PCL president Branch Barrett Rickey wrote a letter to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority to warn that the upgrades needed to keep Cashman at something approaching Triple-A standards would require spending \"tens of millions of dollars.\" Rickey added that even that wouldn't be enough, as many experts inside and outside Las Vegas believed that Cashman was at the end of its useful life. [30] Because it lags so far behind most other facilities in AAA baseball there was danger that Las Vegas would lose its place in minor league baseball's top tier (which happened to Portland after the 2010 season, after plans for a new park fell through). Dissatisfaction with the facilities, along with the lack of a plan to improve the situation, was cited as a major reason the Los Angeles Dodgers did not renew their working agreement with the Las Vegas 51s after it expired in 2008. The Dodgers resumed what had been a long-term affiliation with Albuquerque , where a new ballpark opened in 2003. The 51s plain to construct and open Las Vegas Ballpark in Summerlin by 2019. In 1999, UNLV officials refused to discuss a new agreement with the owners of the Las Vegas Thunder of the International Hockey League to play at the Thomas & Mack Center. Hotels with facilities suitable for the Thunder would not commit to an entire hockey season, as this would have seriously restricted the dates available for concerts and other events. This left the Thunder without a place to play. The team was disbanded, and the city lost hockey for four years. Only the opening of a new arena (considerably smaller than the Thomas & Mack) at the off-Strip Orleans Hotel allowed for the return of hockey with the Las Vegas Wranglers of the ECHL. The ECHL is considered two steps below the NHL, or the equivalent of the 'AA' level in minor league baseball. The Thunder was one step above that. The Wranglers ceased operations after the 2013-'14 season after Orleans Hotel owners Boyd Gaming informed the team that their lease at the Orleans Arena would not be renewed, and efforts to find a new location failed. [31] The Las Vegas Locomotives began play in October 2009 in the inaugural season of the United Football League . The Locos played in the first three UFL championship games , winning the first [32] two [33] against the Florida Tuskers , while losing the 2011 edition to the relocated Tuskers, then the Virginia Destroyers. [34] The head coach was Jim Fassel , former head coach of the NFL's New York Giants . The team played home games at UNLV's Sam Boyd Stadium . The league suspended operations in the middle of the 2012 season , with Las Vegas undefeated through the first four games. [35] Las Vegas, despite being the league's best and most consistent team on the field, was also consistently one of the poorest draws at the gate in the league; their final home game drew only 600 fans into the stadium, a league record low. Af2 , a second-tier arena football league, announced on June 24 that the ArenaCup , the league championship game, would be played in Las Vegas at the Orleans Arena on August 22, 2009. [36] Af2 President Jerry Kurz stated that the league had serious plans to put a team in Las Vegas to play at the Orleans Arena. [37] He said that he had \"no qualms\" about this even given the problems that the Las Vegas Gladiators of the Arena Football League had in the city. This turned out to be the last season of af2 due to the demise of its parent league, the original Arena Football League. In 2005\u201306, the city hosted ArenaBowl XIX and ArenaBowl XX at the Thomas & Mack Center, the AFL's first neutral-site title games. After two years of disappointing attendance the game was moved.

Indoor sporting events are held at the Thomas & Mack Center complex, both at the main arena and at Cox Pavilion , a smaller arena attached to the complex. The College of Southern Nevada (CSN) Coyotes host Scenic West Athletic Conference events on the CSN campus at William R. Morse Stadium and at Heritage Park both in Henderson . The city has become a regional hub for college basketball conference tournaments. The Mountain West Conference (MW) holds its annual tournaments for both men and women at the Thomas & Mack Center. Las Vegas hosted the tournaments for the first seven years of the MW's existence, with the tournaments returning to Las Vegas in 2009 after three years in Denver . In 2009 the West Coast Conference , which does not have a team in Nevada, moved its men's and women's tournaments to the Orleans Arena. The Western Athletic Conference moved both of its tournaments to Las Vegas in 2011. The WAC also plays at the Orleans Arena. On March 14, 2012 the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported that the Pac-12 Conference was moving its men's basketball conference tournament to Las Vegas in 2013, to be played at the MGM Grand Garden Arena . [38] The tournament remained at this venue through the 2016 edition , after which it moved to T-Mobile Arena. Sam Boyd Stadium, current home of UNLV football and the Las Vegas Bowl Las Vegas hosts the Las Vegas Bowl , a college bowl game, around Christmas Day. The game generally pairs a Pac-12 team and an MW team. Despite the state of Nevada having no collegiate wrestling itself, many of the most prestigious college wrestling events are held in the area each year. The Cliff Keen Las Vegas Invitational tournament has been held in the city since 1981. Some of the nations best wrestling teams, such as Michigan, Nebraska, Virginia Tech, Minnesota, Iowa State, Ohio State and Northern Iowa often attend the event. Nearby Reno, also holds a huge wrestling tournament every year for both collegiate and high school wrestling known as The Reno Tournament of Champions. Vegas, has also been home to many international amateur wrestling events. In 2015, Vegas held the World Wrestling Championships at Orleans Arena. Rugby union and variations [ edit ] Main articles: USA Sevens and USA Women's Sevens US Sevens 2012 The Las Vegas Blackjacks RFC are a rugby union team that compete in the Southern California Rugby Football Union . The USA Sevens, the largest annual rugby tournament in North America, has been held in Sam Boyd Stadium every year since 2010. The tournament had been held in late January or early February until 2016 , when it moved to its current date of the first full weekend in March. The USA Sevens, one of the events in the annual World Rugby Sevens Series rugby sevens circuit, moved to Las Vegas from San Diego, where it had previously been held. [3] The 2012 USA Sevens drew over 64,000 fans to the stadium and was broadcast live on NBC . [39] The Sevens World Series is an annual series of tournaments for national sevens teams, with most events featuring 16 teams competing for two distinct trophies. The 2017 edition marked the start of a new era for sevens in Las Vegas. For the first time, the USA Sevens was joined by the USA Women's Sevens, with both tournaments being held on the same weekend at Sam Boyd Stadium. The USA Women's Sevens has been part of the World Rugby Women's Sevens Series since the circuit's creation in 2012\u201313; its first edition had been held in Houston before moving to suburban Atlanta for its next three editions. Only the men's tournament was held in 2018; the women's tournament was superseded by the 2018 Rugby World Cup Sevens in San Francisco . Special sports events [ edit ] The NASCAR Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series has drawn up to 165,000 fans. Las Vegas also hosts a significant number of professional fights. Many of these fights (such as those in MMA 's UFC ) take place near downtown or on the Strip in one of the major resort/hotel/casino event centers. Mandalay Bay is frequently a top contender as a venue for the UFC. Las Vegas submitted a bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics , but did so without United States Olympic Committee (USOC) consent. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) requires that a national Olympic committee nominates a city within their country followed by the submission of the bid to the IOC. The USOC stated that they would not submit a 2020 bid. Las Vegas proceeded without USOC support. The IOC reportedly rejected the bid. [40] The day after the September 1, 2011 deadline for bidding, the IOC revealed the six applicant cities and Las Vegas was not one of them. [41] Individual sports [ edit ] Boxing [ edit ] Las Vegas is host to many professional boxing matches and has hosted many championship bouts, including the following notable bouts: Larry Holmes vs. Muhammad Ali (1980) The Battle of the Little Giants (1981) Sugar Ray Leonard vs. Thomas Hearns (1981, 1989) Larry Holmes vs. Gerry Cooney (1982) Marvin Hagler vs. Thomas Hearns (1985) Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez vs. Meldrick Taylor aka Thunder Meets Lightning (1990) Julio Cesar Chavez Sr. vs. Hector Camacho Sr. (1992) Michael Carbajal vs. Humberto Gonzalez I (1993) Oscar De La Hoya vs. Julio Cesar Chavez Sr. (1996, 1998) The Bite Fight (1997) Fight of the Millennium (1999) Barrera vs. Morales trilogy (2000, 2002, 2004) Oscar De La Hoya vs. Floyd Mayweather (2007) Floyd Mayweather vs. Ricky Hatton (2007) Bernard Hopkins vs. Joe Calzaghe (2008) Ricky Hatton vs. Manny Pacquiao (2009) Floyd Mayweather vs. Manny Pacquiao (2015) Canelo \u00c1lvarez vs. Amir Khan (2016) Sergey Kovalev vs. Andre Ward (2016) Floyd Mayweather vs. Conor McGregor (2017) Canelo \u00c1lvarez vs. Gennady Golovkin (2017) Golf [ edit ] Las Vegas hosts two pro tour events: PGA Tour Shriners Hospitals for Children Open (historically known as the Las Vegas Invitational) PGA Tour Champions Las Vegas Open The Las Vegas Country Club previously hosted the LPGA Takefuji Classic from 2003 until 2006. Mixed martial arts [ edit ] Along with significant rises in popularity in mixed martial arts (MMA), a number of fight leagues such as the premier MMA organization in the world the UFC call Las Vegas home with the headquarters of world operations due to the number of suitable host venues with an annual international fight week held near July 4. The Mandalay Bay Events Center and MGM Grand Garden Arena are among some of the more popular venues for fighting events and have hosted several UFC and other MMA title fights, with the addition of the new T-Mobile Arena . Motorsports [ edit ] NASCAR racing at Las Vegas Motor Speedway Las Vegas has become an internationally known motor racing locale, having hosted the elite Formula One racers at Caesars Palace and the Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) for Indy racers in the early 1980s. Las Vegas is also home to the Mint 400 , an off-road race run in the unforgiving Nevada desert outside Las Vegas. During the race's \"classic era\" from 1967 to 1987, as many as 100,000 spectators lined the 100-mile (160\u00a0km) loop to view the 500-plus off-road racing vehicles. Sponsored by Del Webb's Mint Hotel and Casino, the event was the largest and richest event in the sport. The technical and safety inspection was held on famed Fremont Street and became one of the major must-attend sporting events in Las Vegas history. After the 1987 race, the Del Webb organization sold the Mint Hotel to the adjacent Horseshoe owned by the legendary Binion gaming family, and the race was discontinued after the 1989 edition. In 2008, the Mint 400 was revived under new management, and since 2012 it has been held on a completely new 100-mile desert loop. Over the years, Vegas was the host for the Caesars Palace Grand Prix . The Can-Am Challenge Cup races in 1966\u201368 were held at the old Stardust Raceway and were officially called the Stardust Grand Prix. In July 2006, the Las Vegas City Council approved a 2.44-mile, 14-turn, counterclockwise street circuit in the downtown area for a Champ Car event slated for April 6\u20138, 2007. [42] Las Vegas hosts these motor sports at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway : NASCAR Cup Series : Kobalt 400 NASCAR Xfinity Series : Boyd Gaming 300 NASCAR Truck Series : Las Vegas 350 Denso Spark Plugs NHRA Nationals (April) NHRA Toyota Nationals (November) Monster Jam World Finals at Sam Boyd Stadium (March) Professional wrestling [ edit ] Over the years, Las Vegas has housed many wrestling events for WWE such as WrestleMania IX at Caesars Palace , No Way Out (2001) housed at the Thomas & Mack Center , Vengeance (2005) , Monday Night Raw , and No Way Out (2008) . Las Vegas also hosted World Championship Wrestling 's Halloween Havoc from 1996 to 2000 and TNA Wrestling 's TNA Impact! along with numerous Ring of Honor Pay Per View and televised events including the 13th and 14th Anniversary Shows, along with Death Before Dishonor XIV and Death Before Dishonor XV . Rodeo [ edit ] The National Finals Rodeo has drawn thousands of fans to the city since 1985; a contract extension was signed in 2005 keeping the event in Las Vegas through 2014, followed by another extension that will keep the event in Las Vegas through 2024. The Professional Bull Riders circuit also holds its world finals in Las Vegas. Before 2016, both held their finals at the Thomas & Mack Center, but PBR now holds its finals at T-Mobile Arena. Las Vegas has hosted three Professional Rodeo events: BigHorn Rodeo PBR World Finals (1994\u2013) \u2014 Built Ford Tough World Finals National Finals Rodeo (1985\u2013) \u2014 Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association Wrangler National Finals Rodeo Running and triathlon [ edit ] Rock 'n' Roll Las Vegas Marathon \u2014 The marathon was originally organized by Al Boka in 1983, who eventually sold the marathon in 2005 to Devine Racing , a Chicago-based race organization company that is responsible for several other races, including the Los Angeles Marathon .  Devine redubbed the race as \"The New Las Vegas Marathon\", and updated the course to include the Strip . Introduced on December 4, 2005, the new course marks one of the race occasions that the Strip is closed to traffic.

It is notable for its long association with the English and later British royal family and for its architecture. The original castle was built in the 11th\u00a0century after the Norman invasion of England by William the Conqueror . Since the time of Henry I , it has been used by the reigning monarch and is the longest-occupied palace in Europe. The castle's lavish early 19th-century State Apartments were described by the art historian Hugh Roberts as \"a superb and unrivalled sequence of rooms widely regarded as the finest and most complete expression of later Georgian taste\". [4] Inside the castle walls is the 15th-century St\u00a0George's Chapel , considered by the historian John Martin Robinson to be \"one of the supreme achievements of English Perpendicular Gothic\" design. [5] Originally designed to protect Norman dominance around the outskirts of London and oversee a strategically important part of the River Thames , Windsor Castle was built as a motte-and-bailey , with three wards surrounding a central mound. Gradually replaced with stone fortifications, the castle withstood a prolonged siege during the First Barons' War at the start of the 13th\u00a0century. Henry III built a luxurious royal palace within the castle during the middle of the century, and Edward III went further, rebuilding the palace to make an even grander set of buildings in what would become \"the most expensive secular building project of the entire Middle Ages in England\". [6] Edward's core design lasted through the Tudor period, during which Henry VIII and Elizabeth I made increasing use of the castle as a royal court and centre for diplomatic entertainment. Windsor Castle survived the tumultuous period of the English Civil War , when it was used as a military headquarters by Parliamentary forces and a prison for Charles I . At the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, Charles II rebuilt much of Windsor Castle with the help of the architect Hugh May , creating a set of extravagant Baroque interiors that are still admired. After a period of neglect during the 18th\u00a0century, George III and George IV renovated and rebuilt Charles II's palace at colossal expense, producing the current design of the State Apartments, full of Rococo , Gothic and Baroque furnishings. Queen Victoria made a few minor changes to the castle, which became the centre for royal entertainment for much of her reign. Windsor Castle was used as a refuge by the royal family during the Luftwaffe bombing campaigns of the Second World War and survived a fire in 1992 . It is a popular tourist attraction, a venue for hosting state visits, and the preferred weekend home of Elizabeth II .

[8] The present-day castle was created during a sequence of phased building projects, culminating in the reconstruction work after a fire in 1992 . [9] It is in essence a Georgian and Victorian design based on a medieval structure, with Gothic features reinvented in a modern style. Since the 14th century, architecture at the castle has attempted to produce a contemporary reinterpretation of older fashions and traditions, repeatedly imitating outmoded or even antiquated styles. [10] As a result, architect Sir William Whitfield has pointed to Windsor Castle's architecture as having \"a certain fictive quality\", the Picturesque and Gothic design generating \"a sense that a theatrical performance is being put on here\", despite late 20th century efforts to expose more of the older structures to increase the sense of authenticity. [11] Although there has been some criticism, the castle's architecture and history lends it a \"place amongst the greatest European palaces\". [12] Middle Ward [ edit ] At the heart of Windsor Castle is the Middle Ward, a bailey formed around the motte or artificial hill in the centre of the ward. The motte is 50 feet (15\u00a0m) high and is made from chalk originally excavated from the surrounding ditch. The keep, called the Round Tower, on the top of the motte is based on an original 12th-century building, extended upwards in the early 19th century under architect Jeffry Wyatville by 30\u00a0ft (9\u00a0m) to produce a more imposing height and silhouette. [13] The interior of the Round Tower was further redesigned in 1991\u20133 to provide additional space for the Royal Archives , an additional room being built in the space left by Wyatville's originally hollow extension. [13] The Round Tower is in reality far from cylindrical , due to the shape and structure of the motte beneath it. The current height of the tower has been criticised as being disproportionate to its width; archaeologist Tim Tatton-Brown, for example, has described it as a mutilation of the earlier medieval structure. [14] The western entrance to the Middle Ward is now open, and a gateway leads north from the ward onto the North Terrace. [15] The eastern exit from the ward is guarded by the Norman Gatehouse. [15] This gatehouse , which, despite its name, dates from the 14th century, is heavily vaulted and decorated with carvings, including surviving medieval lion masks , traditional symbols of majesty, to form an impressive entrance to the Upper Ward. [16] Wyatville redesigned the exterior of the gatehouse, and the interior was later heavily converted in the 19th century for residential use. [17] Upper Ward [ edit ] The South Wing of the Upper Ward; the Official Entrance to the State Apartments is on the left. The Upper Ward of Windsor Castle comprises a number of major buildings enclosed by the upper bailey wall, forming a central quadrangle. The State Apartments run along the north of the ward, with a range of buildings along the east wall, and the private royal apartments and the King George IV Gate to the south, with the Edward III Tower in the south-west corner. The motte and the Round Tower form the west edge of the ward. A bronze statue of Charles II on horseback sits beneath the Round Tower. [18] Inspired by Hubert Le Sueur 's statue of Charles I in London, the statue was cast by Josias Ibach in 1679, with the marble plinth featuring carvings by Grinling Gibbons . [18] The Upper Ward adjoins the North Terrace, which overlooks the River Thames , and the East Terrace, which overlooks the gardens; both of the current terraces were constructed by Hugh May in the 17th century. [19] Traditionally the Upper Ward was judged to be \"to all intents and purposes a nineteenth-century creation\u00a0... the image of what the early nineteenth-century thought a castle should be\", as a result of the extensive redesign of the castle by Wyatville under George IV. [20] The walls of the Upper Ward are built of Bagshot Heath stone faced on the inside with regular bricks, the gothic details in yellow Bath stone . [21] The buildings in the Upper Ward are characterised by the use of small bits of flint in the mortar for galletting , originally started at the castle in the 17th century to give stonework from disparate periods a similar appearance. The skyline of the Upper Ward is designed to be dramatic when seen from a distance or silhouetted against the horizon, an image of tall towers and battlements influenced by the picturesque movement of the late 18th century. [21] Archaeological and restoration work following the 1992 fire has shown the extent to which the current structure represents a survival of elements from the original 12th-century stone walls onwards, presented within the context of Wyatville's final remodelling. [22] State Apartments [ edit ] The State Apartments in the Upper Ward \u2013 (l to r) Queen's Audience and Presence Chambers, the Official Entrance, St George's Hall, the Guest's Entrance [23] The State Apartments form the major part of the Upper Ward and lie along the north side of the quadrangle. The modern building follows the medieval foundations laid down by Edward III, with the ground floor comprising service chambers and cellars, and the much grander first floor forming the main part of the palace. On the first floor, the layout of the western end of the State Apartments is primarily the work of architect Hugh May , whereas the structure on the eastern side represents Jeffry Wyatville's plans. [nb 1] The interior of the State Apartments was mostly designed by Wyatville in the early 19th century. Wyatville intended each room to illustrate a particular architectural style and to display the matching furnishings and fine arts of the period. [24] With some alterations over the years, this concept continues to dominate the apartments. Different rooms follow the Classical , Gothic and Rococo styles, together with an element of Jacobethan in places. [25] Many of the rooms on the eastern end of the castle had to be restored following the 1992 fire, using \"equivalent restoration\" methods\u00a0\u2013 the rooms were restored so as to appear similar to their original appearance, but using modern materials and concealing modern structural improvements. [26] [nb 2] These rooms were also partially redesigned at the same time to more closely match modern tastes. Art historian Hugh Roberts has praised the State Apartments as \"a superb and unrivalled sequence of rooms widely regarded as the finest and most complete expression of later Georgian taste.\" [4] Others, such as architect Robin Nicolson and critic Hugh Pearman , have described them as \"bland\" and \"distinctly dull\". [27] The Crimson Drawing Room in 2007 following the 1992 fire and subsequent remodelling Wyatville's most famous work are those rooms designed in a Rococo style. These rooms take the fluid, playful aspects of this mid-18th-century artistic movement, including many original pieces of Louis XV decoration, but project them on a \"vastly inflated\" scale. [28] Investigations after the 1992 fire have shown though that many Rococo features of the modern castle, originally thought to have been 18th-century fittings transferred from Carlton House or France, are in fact 19th-century imitations in plasterwork and wood, designed to blend with original elements. [29] The Grand Reception Room is the most prominent of these Rococo designs, 100\u00a0ft (30\u00a0m) long and 40\u00a0ft (12\u00a0m) tall and occupying the site of Edward III's great hall. [30] This room, restored after the fire, includes a huge French Rococo ceiling, characterised by Ian Constantinides, the lead restorer, as possessing a \"coarseness of form and crudeness of hand\u00a0... completely overshadowed by the sheer spectacular effect when you are at a distance\". [31] The room is set off by a set of restored Gobelins French tapestries . [31] Although decorated with less gold leaf than in the 1820s, the result remains \"one of the greatest set-pieces of Regency decoration\". [32] The White, Green and Crimson Drawing Rooms include a total of 62 trophies : carved, gilded wooden panels illustrating weapons and the spoils of war, many with Masonic meanings. [33] Restored or replaced after the fire, these trophies are famous for their \"vitality, precision and three-dimensional quality\", and were originally brought from Carlton House in 1826, some being originally imported from France and others carved by Edward Wyatt. [33] The soft furnishings of these rooms, although luxurious, are more modest than the 1820s originals, both on the grounds of modern taste and cost. [34] Wyatville's design retains three rooms originally built by May in the 17th century in partnership with the painter Antonio Verrio and carver Grinling Gibbons . The Queen's Presence Chamber, the Queen's Audience Chamber and the King's Dining Room are designed in a Baroque, Franco-Italian style, characterised by \"gilded interiors enriched with florid murals\", first introduced to England between 1648\u201350 at Wilton House . [35] Verrio's paintings are \"drenched in medievalist allusion\" and classical images. [36] These rooms were intended to show an innovative English \"baroque fusion\" of the hitherto separate arts of architecture, painting and carving. [37] A presentation drawing for the new Private Chapel, showing a Gothic design by Giles Downes A handful of rooms in the modern State Apartments reflect either 18th-century or Victorian Gothic design. The State Dining Room, for example, whose current design originates from the 1850s but which was badly damaged during the 1992 fire, is restored to its appearance in the 1920s, before the removal of some of the gilded features on the pilasters. [38] Anthony Salvin 's Grand Staircase is also of mid-Victorian design in the Gothic style, rising to a double-height hall lit by an older 18th-century Gothic vaulted lantern tower called the Grand Vestibule, designed by James Wyatt and executed by Francis Bernasconi . [39] The staircase has been criticised by historian John Robinson as being a distinctly inferior design to the earlier staircases built on the same site by both Wyatt and May. [40] Some parts of the State Apartments were completely destroyed in the 1992 fire and this area was rebuilt in a style called \"Downesian Gothic\", named after the architect, Giles Downes . [41] [nb 3] The style comprises \"the rather stripped, cool and systematic coherence of modernism sewn into a reinterpretation of the Gothic tradition\". [42] Downes argues that the style avoids \"florid decoration\", emphasising an organic, flowing Gothic structure. [43] Three new rooms were built or remodelled by Downes at Windsor. Downes' new roof of St George's Hall is the largest green-oak structure built since the Middle Ages, and is decorated with brightly coloured shields celebrating the heraldic element of the Order of the Garter ; the design attempts to create an illusion of additional height through the gothic woodwork along the ceiling. [44] The Lantern Lobby features flowing oak columns forming a vaulted ceiling, imitating an arum lily . [45] The new Private Chapel is relatively small, only able to fit thirty worshippers, but combines architectural elements of the St George's Hall roof with the Lantern Lobby and the stepped arch structure of the Henry VIII chapel vaulting at Hampton Court . [46] The result is an \"extraordinary, continuous and closely moulded net of tracery\", complementing the new stained glass windows commemorating the fire, designed by Joseph Nuttgen. [47] The Great Kitchen, with its newly exposed 14th-century roof lantern sitting alongside Wyatville's fireplaces, chimneys and Gothic tables, is also a product of the reconstruction after the fire. [48] The ground floor of the State Apartments retains various famous medieval features. The 14th-century Great Undercroft still survives, some 193 feet (59\u00a0m) long by 31 feet (9.4\u00a0m) wide, divided into 13 bays. [49] At the time of the 1992 fire, the Undercroft had been divided into smaller rooms; the area is now opened up to form a single space in an effort to echo the undercrofts at Fountains and Rievaulx Abbeys , although the floor remains artificially raised for convenience of use. [50] The \"beautifully vaulted\" 14th-century Larderie passage runs alongside the Kitchen Courtyard and is decorated with carved royal roses, marking its construction by Edward III. [51] [nb 4] Lower Ward [ edit ] The Lower Ward, (l to r) St George's Chapel , the Lady Chapel, the Round Tower, the lodgings of the Military Knights , and the residence of the Governor of the Military Knights The Lower Ward lies below and to the west of the Round Tower, reached through the Norman Gate. Originally largely of medieval design, most of the Lower Ward was renovated or reconstructed during the mid-Victorian period by Anthony Salvin and Edward Blore , to form a \"consistently Gothic composition\". [52] The Lower Ward holds St George's Chapel and most of the buildings associated with the Order of the Garter. On the north side of the Lower Ward is St George's Chapel. This huge building is the spiritual home of the Order of the Knights of the Garter and dates from the late 15th and early 16th century, designed in the Perpendicular Gothic style. [53] The ornate wooden choir stalls are of 15th-century design, having been restored and extended by Henry Emlyn at the end of the 18th century, and are decorated with a unique set of brass plates showing the arms of the Knights of the Garter over the last six centuries. [54] On the west side, the chapel has a grand Victorian door and staircase, used on ceremonial occasions. [55] The east stained glass window is Victorian, and the oriel window to the north side of it was built by Henry VIII for Catherine of Aragon . [56] The vault in front of the altar houses the remains of Henry VIII , Jane Seymour and Charles I , with Edward IV buried nearby. [57] The chapel is considered by historian John Robinson to be \"one of the supreme achievements of English Perpendicular Gothic\" design. [5] The Horseshoe Cloister, built in 1480 and reconstructed in the 19th century At the east end of St George's Chapel is the Lady Chapel, originally built by Henry III in the 13th century and converted into the Albert Memorial Chapel between 1863\u201373 by George Gilbert Scott . [55] Built to commemorate the life of Prince Albert , the ornate chapel features lavish decoration and works in marble, glass mosaic and bronze by Henri de Triqueti, Susan Durant, Alfred Gilbert and Antonio Salviati . [55] The east door of the chapel, covered in ornamental ironwork, is the original door from 1246. [58] At the west end of the Lower Ward is the Horseshoe Cloister, originally built in 1480, near to the chapel to house its clergy. It houses the vicars-choral, or lay clerks of the chapel. [59] This curved brick and timber building is said to have been designed to resemble the shape of a fetlock , one of the badges used by Edward IV. George Gilbert Scott heavily restored the building in 1871 and little of the original structure remains. [59] Other ranges originally built by Edward III sit alongside the Horseshoe, featuring stone perpendicular tracery . [60] As of 2011, they are used as offices, a library and as the houses for the Dean and Canons . [60] Behind the Horseshoe Cloister is the Curfew Tower, one of the oldest surviving parts of the Lower Ward and dating from the 13th century. [55] The interior of the tower contains a former dungeon, and the remnants of a sally port , a secret exit for the occupants in a time of siege. [61] The upper storey contains the castle bells placed there in 1478, and the castle clock of 1689. The French-style conical roof is a 19th-century attempt by Anthony Salvin to remodel the tower in the fashion of Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc 's recreation of Carcassonne . [62] On the opposite side of the chapel is a range of buildings including the lodgings of the Military Knights , and the residence of the Governor of the Military Knights . [63] These buildings originate from the 16th century and are still used by the Knights, who represent the Order of the Garter each Sunday. [64] On the south side of the Ward is King Henry VIII's gateway, which bears the coat of arms of Catherine of Aragon and forms the secondary entrance to the castle. Park and landscape [ edit ] Windsor Castle's position on top of steep ground has meant that the castle's gardens are limited in scale. [65] The castle gardens stretch east from the Upper Ward across a 19th-century terrace. [66] Windsor Castle is surrounded by extensive parkland. The immediate area stretching to the east of the castle is a 19th-century creation known as the Home Park . [67] The Home Park includes parkland and two working farms, along with many estate cottages mainly occupied by employees and the Frogmore estate. The Long Walk, a double lined avenue of trees, runs for 2.65 miles (4.26\u00a0km) [68] south of the castle, and is 240\u00a0ft (75\u00a0m) wide. [69] The original 17th-century elms were replaced with alternating chestnut and plane trees. The impact of Dutch elm disease led to large-scale replanting after 1945. [70] The Home Park adjoins the northern edge of the more extensive Windsor Great Park , occupying some 5,000 acres (2,020\u00a0ha) [71] and including some of the oldest broadleaved woodlands in Europe. [72] In the Home Park, to the north of the castle, stands a private school, St George's , which provides choristers to the chapel. Eton College is located about half a mile from the castle, across the River Thames . An aerial view of the castle: (l to r) the Lower Ward, the Middle Ward and Round Tower, the Upper Ward, with the Long Walk in the lower right hand corner. The River Thames can be seen in the upper left of the picture. History [ edit ] 11th and 12th centuries [ edit ] The Round Tower in the Middle Ward, built by Henry II and remodelled in the 19th century Windsor Castle was originally built by William the Conqueror in the decade after the Norman conquest of 1066. [73] William established a defensive ring of motte and bailey castles around London; each was a day's march\u00a0\u2013 about 20 miles (32\u00a0km)\u00a0\u2013 from the city and from the next castle, allowing for easy reinforcements in a crisis. [73] Windsor Castle, one of this ring of fortifications, was strategically important because of its proximity to both the River Thames , a key medieval route into London, and Windsor Forest , a royal hunting preserve previously used by the Saxon kings. [74] The nearby settlement of Clivore, or Clewer , was an old Saxon residence. The initial wooden castle consisted of a keep on the top of a man-made motte , or mound, protected by a small bailey wall, occupying a chalk inlier , or bluff, rising 100\u00a0ft (30\u00a0m) above the river. [75] A second wooden bailey was constructed to the east of the keep, forming the later Upper Ward. [76] By the end of the century, another bailey had been constructed to the west, creating the basic shape of the modern castle. [76] [nb 5] In design, Windsor most closely resembled Arundel Castle , another powerful early Norman fortification, but the double bailey design was also found at Rockingham and Alnwick Castle . [78] Windsor was not initially used as a royal residence; the early Norman kings preferred to use the former palace of Edward the Confessor in the village of Old Windsor . [79] The first king to use Windsor Castle as a residence was Henry I , who celebrated Whitsuntide at the castle in 1110 during a period of heightened insecurity. [80] Henry's marriage to Adela , the daughter of Godfrey of Louvain , took place in the castle in 1121. During this period the keep suffered a substantial collapse\u00a0\u2013 archaeological evidence shows that the southern side of the motte subsided by over 6\u00a0ft (2\u00a0m). [81] Timber piles were driven in to support the motte and the old wooden keep was replaced with a new stone shell keep , with a probable gateway to the north-east and a new stone well. [82] A chemise , or low protective wall, was subsequently added to the keep. [82] Henry II came to the throne in 1154 and built extensively at Windsor between 1165 and 1179. [76] Henry replaced the wooden palisade surrounding the upper ward with a stone wall interspersed with square towers and built the first King's Gate. [76] The first stone keep was suffering from subsidence, and cracks were beginning to appear in the stonework of the south side. [82] Henry replaced the keep with another stone shell keep and chemise wall, but moved the walls in from the edge of the motte to relieve the pressure on the mound, and added massive foundations along the south side to provide additional support. [82] Inside the castle Henry remodelled the royal accommodation. [76] Bagshot Heath stone was used for most of the work, and stone from Bedfordshire for the internal buildings. [83] 13th century [ edit ] The Curfew Tower, part of the Lower Ward, built under Henry III and remodelled in the 19th century King John undertook some building works at Windsor, but primarily to the accommodation rather than the defences. [84] The castle played a role during the revolt of the English barons : the castle was besieged in 1214, and John used the castle as his base during the negotiations before the signing of the Magna Carta at nearby Runnymede in 1215. [84] In 1216 the castle was besieged again by baronial and French troops under the command of the Count of Nevers , but John's constable , Engelard de Cigogn\u00e9 , successfully defended it. [84] The damage done to the castle during the second siege was immediately repaired in 1216 and 1221 by Cigogne on behalf of John's successor Henry III , who further strengthened the defences. [85] The walls of the Lower Ward were rebuilt in stone, complete with a gatehouse in the location of the future Henry VIII Gate, between 1224 and 1230. [76] Three new towers, the Curfew, Garter and the Salisbury towers, were constructed. [84] The Middle Ward was heavily reinforced with a southern stone wall, protected by the new Edward III and Henry III towers at each end. [76] Windsor Castle was one of Henry's three favourite residences and he invested heavily in the royal accommodation, spending more money at Windsor than in any other of his properties. [86] [nb 6] Following his marriage to Eleanor of Provence , Henry built a luxurious palace in 1240\u201363, based around a court along the north side of the Upper Ward. [87] This was intended primarily for the queen and Henry's children. [76] In the Lower Ward, the king ordered the construction of a range of buildings for his own use along the south wall, including a 70\u00a0ft (21\u00a0m) long chapel, later called the Lady Chapel . [88] This was the grandest of the numerous chapels built for his own use, and comparable to the Sainte-Chapelle in Paris in size and quality. [89] Henry repaired the Great Hall that lay along the north side of the Lower Ward, and enlarged it with a new kitchen and built a covered walkway between the Hall and the kitchen. [88] Henry's work was characterised by the religious overtones of the rich decorations, which formed \"one of the high-water marks of English medieval art\". [90] The conversion cost more than \u00a310,000. [85] The result was to create a division in the castle between a more private Upper Ward and a Lower Ward devoted to the public face of the monarchy. [58] Little further building was carried out at the castle during the 13th century; the Great Hall in the Lower Ward was destroyed by fire in 1296, but it was not rebuilt. [91] 14th century [ edit ] The Norman Gate, built by Edward III and remodelled in the 19th century Edward III was born at Windsor Castle and used it extensively throughout his reign. [91] In 1344 the king announced the foundation of the new Order of the Round Table at the castle. [6] Edward began to construct a new building in the castle to host this order, but it was never finished. [6] Chroniclers described it as a round building, 200\u00a0ft (61\u00a0m) across, and it was probably in the centre of the Upper Ward. [92] Shortly afterwards, Edward abandoned the new order for reasons that remain unclear, and instead established the Order of the Garter , again with Windsor Castle as its headquarters, complete with the attendant Poor Knights of Windsor . [6] As part of this process Edward decided to rebuild Windsor Castle, in particular Henry III's palace, in an attempt to construct a castle that would be symbolic of royal power and chivalry. [93] Edward was influenced both by the military successes of his grandfather, Edward I, and by the decline of royal authority under his father, Edward II, and aimed to produce an innovative, \"self-consciously aesthetic, muscled, martial architecture\". [94] Edward placed William of Wykeham in overall charge of the rebuilding and design of the new castle and whilst work was ongoing Edward stayed in temporary accommodation in the Round Tower. [91] Between 1350 and 1377 Edward spent \u00a351,000 on renovating Windsor Castle; this was the largest amount spent by any English medieval monarch on a single building operation, and over one and a half times Edward's typical annual income of \u00a330,000. [95] Some of the costs of the castle were paid from the results of ransoms following Edward's victories at the battles of Cr\u00e9cy , Calais and Poitiers . [91] Windsor Castle was already a substantial building before Edward began expanding it, making the investment all the more impressive, and much of the expenditure was lavished on rich furnishings. [96] The castle was \"the most expensive secular building project of the entire Middle Ages in England\". [6] Edward's new palace consisted of three courts along the north side of the Upper Ward, called Little Cloister, King's Cloister and the Kitchen Court. [97] At the front of the palace lay the St George's Hall range, which combined a new hall and a new chapel. This range had two symmetrical gatehouses, the Spicerie Gatehouse and the Kitchen Gatehouse. The Spicerie Gatehouse was the main entrance into the palace, whilst the Kitchen Gatehouse simply led into the kitchen courtyard. [98] The great hall had numerous large windows looking out across the ward. [99] The range had an unusual, unified roof-line and, with a taller roof than the rest of the palace, would have been highly distinctive. [100] The Rose Tower, designed for the king's private use, set off the west corner of the range. [97] The result was a \"great and apparently architecturally unified palace\u00a0... uniform in all sorts of ways, as to roof line, window heights, cornice line, floor and ceiling heights\". [101] With the exception of the Hall, Chapel and the Great Chamber, the new interiors all shared a similar height and width. [102] [nb 7] The defensive features, however, were primarily for show, possibly to provide a backdrop for jousting between the two-halves of the Order of the Garter. [94] A reconstruction of the St George's Hall range built by Edward III : (l to r) the Spicerie Gatehouse, the chapel, the hall, the Kitchen Gatehouse Edward built further luxurious, self-contained lodgings for his court around the east and south edges of the Upper Ward, creating the modern shape of the quadrangle. [10] The Norman gate was built to secure the west entrance to the Ward. [91] In the Lower Ward, the chapel was enlarged and remodelled with grand buildings for the canons built alongside. [91] The earliest weight-driven mechanical clock in England was installed by Edward III in the Round Tower in 1354. [103] William of Wykeham went on to build New College, Oxford and Winchester College , where the influence of Windsor Castle can easily be seen. [91] The new castle was used to hold French prisoners taken in at Poitiers in 1357, including John II , who was held for a considerable ransom . [104] Later in the century, the castle also found favour with Richard II . Richard conducted restoration work on St George's Chapel, the work being carried out by Geoffrey Chaucer , who served as a diplomat and Clerk of The King's Works. 15th century [ edit ] St George's Chapel , begun in 1475 by Edward IV Windsor Castle continued to be favoured by monarchs in the 15th century, despite England beginning to slip into increasing political violence. [105] Henry IV seized the castle during his coup in 1399, although failing to catch Richard II , who had escaped to London. [105] Under Henry V , the castle hosted a visit from the Holy Roman Emperor in 1417, a massive diplomatic event that stretched the accommodation of the castle to its limits. [106] By the middle of the 15th century England was increasingly divided between the rival royal factions of the Lancastrians and the Yorkists . Castles such as Windsor did not play a decisive role during the resulting Wars of the Roses (1455\u201385), which were fought primarily in the form of pitched battles between the rival factions. [107] Henry VI , born at Windsor Castle and known as Henry of Windsor, became king at the young age of nine months. [108] His long period of minority, coupled with the increasing tensions between Henry's Lancastrian supporters and the Yorkists, distracted attention from Windsor. [109] The Garter Feasts and other ceremonial activities at the castle became more infrequent and less well attended. [109] Edward IV seized power in 1461. When Edward captured Henry's wife, Margaret of Anjou , she was brought back to be detained at the castle. [110] Edward began to revive the Order of the Garter, and held a particularly lavish feast in 1472. [111] Edward began the construction of the present St. George's Chapel in 1475, resulting in the dismantling of several of the older buildings in the Lower Ward. [112] By building the grand chapel Edward was seeking to show that his new dynasty were the permanent rulers of England, and may also have been attempting to deliberately rival the similar chapel that Henry VI had ordered to be constructed at nearby Eton College . [109] Richard III made only a brief use of Windsor Castle before his defeat at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, but had the body of Henry VI moved from Chertsey Abbey in Surrey to the castle to allow it to be visited by pilgrims more easily. [113] Henry VII made more use of Windsor. In 1488, shortly after succeeding to the throne, he held a massive feast for the Order of the Garter at the castle. [114] He completed the roof of St George's Chapel, and set about converting the older eastern Lady Chapel into a proposed shrine to Henry VI, whose canonisation was then considered imminent. [114] In the event, Henry VI was not canonised and the project was abandoned, although the shrine continued to attract a flood of pilgrims. [115] Henry VII appears to have remodelled the King's Chamber in the palace, and had the roof of the Great Kitchen rebuilt in 1489. [116] He also built a three-storied tower on the west end of the palace, which he used for his personal apartments. [117] Windsor began to be used for international diplomatic events, including the grand visit of Philip I of Castile in 1506. [114] William de la Pole , one of the surviving Yorkist claimants to the throne, was imprisoned at Windsor Castle during Henry's reign, before his execution in 1513. [118] 16th century [ edit ] The Henry VIII gateway in the Lower Ward Henry VIII enjoyed Windsor Castle, as a young man \"exercising himself daily in shooting, singing, dancing, wrestling, casting of the bar, playing at the recorders, flute, virginals, in setting of songs and making of ballads\". [119] The tradition of the Garter Feasts was maintained and became more extravagant; the size of the royal retinue visiting Windsor had to be restricted because of the growing numbers. [120] During the Pilgrimage of Grace , a huge uprising in the north of England against Henry's rule in 1536, the king used Windsor as a secure base in the south from which to manage his military response. [121] Throughout the Tudor period, Windsor was also used as a safe retreat in the event of plagues occurring in London. [122] Henry rebuilt the principal castle gateway in about 1510 and constructed a tennis court at the base of the motte in the Upper Ward. [123] He also built a long terrace, called the North Wharf, along the outside wall of the Upper Ward; constructed of wood, it was designed to provide a commanding view of the River Thames below. [116] The design included an outside staircase into the king's apartments, which made the monarch's life more comfortable at the expense of considerably weakening the castle's defences. [124] Early in his reign, Henry had given the eastern Lady Chapel to Cardinal Wolsey for Wolsey's future mausoleum. [125] Benedetto Grazzini converted much of this into an Italian Renaissance design, before Wolsey's fall from power brought an end to the project, with contemporaries estimating that around \u00a360,000 (\u00a3295\u00a0million in 2008 terms) had been spent on the work. [126] Henry continued the project, but it remained unfinished when he himself was buried in the chapel, in an elaborate funeral in 1547. [127] Windsor Castle in the 1670s from across the River Thames , showing the North Terrace (left) built by Elizabeth I in the 16th century and the steep, protective ground to the north of the castle. By contrast, the young Edward VI disliked Windsor Castle. [128] Edward's Protestant beliefs led him to simplify the Garter ceremonies, to discontinue the annual Feast of the Garter at Windsor and to remove any signs of Catholic practices with the Order. [129] During the rebellions and political strife of 1549, Windsor was again used as a safe-haven for the king and the Duke of Somerset . [130] Edward famously commented whilst staying at Windsor Castle during this period that \"Methink I am in a prison, here are no galleries, nor no gardens to walk in\". [128] Under both Edward and his sister, Mary I , some limited building work continued at the castle, in many cases using resources recovered from the English abbeys. [131] Water was piped into the Upper Ward to create a fountain. [116] Mary also expanded the buildings used by the Knights of Windsor in the Lower Ward, using stone from Reading Abbey . [116] Elizabeth I spent much of her time at Windsor Castle and used it a safe haven in crises, \"knowing it could stand a siege if need be\". [132] Ten new brass cannons were purchased for the castle's defence. [133] It became one of her favourite locations and she spent more money on the property than on any of her other palaces. [134] She conducted some modest building works at Windsor, including a wide range of repairs to the existing structures. [135] She converted the North Wharf into a permanent, huge stone terrace, complete with statues, carvings and an octagonal, outdoor banqueting house, raising the western end of the terrace to provide more privacy. [136] The chapel was refitted with stalls, a gallery and a new ceiling. [137] A bridge was built over the ditch to the south of the castle to enable easier access to the park. [134] Elizabeth built a gallery range of buildings on the west end of the Upper Ward, alongside Henry VII's tower. [138] Elizabeth increasingly used the castle for diplomatic engagements, but space continued to prove a challenge as the property was simply not as large as the more modern royal palaces. [139] This flow of foreign visitors was captured for the queen's entertainment in William Shakespeare 's play, The Merry Wives of Windsor . [140] [nb 8] 17th century [ edit ] A bird's-eye view of Windsor Castle in 1658, by Wenceslas Hollar , shown before Hugh May 's reconstruction of the Upper Ward James I used Windsor Castle primarily as a base for hunting, one of his favourite pursuits, and for socialising with his friends. [141] Many of these occasions involved extensive drinking sessions, including one with Christian IV of Denmark in 1606 that became infamous across Europe for the resulting drunken behaviour of the two kings. [142] The absence of space at Windsor continued to prove problematic, with James' English and Scottish retinues often quarrelling over rooms. [142] Charles I was a connoisseur of art, and paid greater attention to the aesthetic aspects of Windsor Castle than his predecessors. [143] Charles had the castle completely surveyed by a team including Inigo Jones in 1629, but little of the recommended work was carried out. [137] Nonetheless, Charles employed Nicholas Stone to improve the chapel gallery in the Mannerist style and to construct a gateway in the North Terrace. [137] Christian van Vianen, a noted Dutch goldsmith, was employed to produce a baroque gold service for the St George's Chapel altar. In the final years of peace, Charles demolished the fountain in the Upper Ward, intending to replace it with a classical statue. [144] In 1642 the English Civil War broke out, dividing the country into the Royalist supporters of Charles, and the Parliamentarians . In the aftermath of the battle of Edgehill in October, Parliament became concerned that Charles might advance on London. [145] John Venn took control of Windsor Castle with twelve companies of foot soldiers to protect the route along the Thames river, becoming the governor of the castle for the duration of the war. [145] The contents of St George's Chapel were both valuable and, to many Parliamentary forces, inappropriately high church in style. [145] Looting began immediately: Edward IV's bejewelled coat of mail was stolen; the chapel's organs, windows and books destroyed; the Lady Chapel was emptied of valuables, including the component parts of Henry VIII's unfinished tomb. [146] By the end of the war, some 3580\u00a0oz (101\u00a0kg) of gold and silver plate had been looted. [145] Prince Rupert of the Rhine , a prominent Royalist general, attempted to relieve Windsor Castle that November. [145] Rupert's small force of cavalry was able to take the town of Windsor, but was unable to overcome the walls at Windsor Castle\u00a0\u2013 in due course, Rupert was forced to retreat. [147] Over the winter of 1642\u20133, Windsor Castle was converted into the headquarters for the Earl of Essex , a senior Parliamentary general. [147] The Horseshoe Cloister was taken over as a prison for captured Royalists, and the resident canons were expelled from the castle. [147] The Lady Chapel was turned into a magazine . [148] Looting by the underpaid garrison continued to be a problem; 500\u00a0royal deer were killed across the Windsor Great Park during the winter, and fences were burned as firewood. [147] In 1647 Charles, then a prisoner of Parliament, was brought to the castle for a period under arrest, before being moved to Hampton Court . [147] In 1648 there was a Royalist plan, never enacted, to seize Windsor Castle. [149] The Parliamentary Army Council moved into Windsor in November and decided to try Charles for treason. [149] Charles was held at Windsor again for the last three weeks of his reign; after his execution in January 1649, his body was taken back to Windsor that night through a snowstorm, to be interred without ceremony in the vault beneath St George's Chapel . [150] Windsor Castle in 1658, as seen from the south-east, by Wenceslas Hollar ; (l to r) the Lower Ward, the Middle Ward and Round Tower, the Upper Ward The Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 saw the first period of significant change to Windsor Castle for many years. The civil war and the years of the Interregnum had caused extensive damage to the royal palaces in England. [151] At the same time the shifting \"functional requirements, patterns of movement, modes of transport, aesthetic taste and standards of comfort\" amongst royal circles was changing the qualities being sought in a successful palace. [151] Windsor was the only royal palace to be successfully fully modernised by Charles II in the Restoration years. [151] During the Interregnum, however, squatters had occupied Windsor Castle. As a result, the \"King's house was a wreck; the fanatic, the pilferer, and the squatter, having been at work\u00a0... Paupers had squatted in many of the towers and cabinets\". [152] Shortly after returning to England, Charles appointed Prince Rupert , one of his few surviving close relatives, to be the Constable of Windsor Castle in 1668. [153] Rupert immediately began to reorder the castle's defences, repairing the Round Tower and reconstructing the real tennis court. [154] Charles attempted to restock Windsor Great Park with deer brought over from Germany, but the herds never recovered their pre-war size. [147] Rupert created apartments for himself in the Round Tower, decorated with an \"extraordinary\" number of weapons and armour, with his inner chambers \"hung with tapisserie, curious and effeminate pictures\". [155] The Upper Ward seen from the east, after Hugh May 's reconstruction work. May's new East Terrace is in the foreground Charles was heavily influenced by Louis XIV style and imitated French design at his palace at Winchester and the Royal Hospital at Chelsea . [156] At Windsor, Charles created \"the most extravagantly Baroque interiors ever executed in England\". [156] Much of the building work was paid for out of increased royal revenues from Ireland during the 1670s. [157] French court etiquette at the time required a substantial number of enfiladed rooms to satisfy court protocol; the demand for space forced architect Hugh May to expand out into the North Terrace, rebuilding and widening it in the process. [158] This new building was called the Star Building, because Charles II placed a huge gilt Garter star on the side of it. [158] May took down and rebuilt the walls of Edward III's hall and chapel, incorporating larger windows but retaining the height and dimensions of the medieval building. [158] Although Windsor Castle was now big enough to hold the entire court, it was not built with chambers for the King's Council, as would be found in Whitehall . [159] Instead Charles took advantage of the good road links emerging around Windsor to hold his council meetings at Hampton Court when he was staying at the castle. [159] The result became an \"exemplar\" for royal buildings for the next twenty-five years. [160] The result of May's work showed a medievalist leaning; although sometimes criticised for its \"dullness\", May's reconstruction was both sympathetic to the existing castle and a deliberate attempt to create a slightly austere 17th-century version of a \"neo-Norman\" castle. [161] William III commissioned Nicholas Hawksmoor and Sir Christopher Wren to conduct a large, final classical remodelling of the Upper Ward, but the king's early death caused the plan to be cancelled. [162] Queen Anne was fond of the castle, and attempted to address the lack of a formal garden by instructing Henry Wise to begin work on the Maestricht Garden beneath the North Terrace, which was never completed. [162] Anne also created the racecourse at Ascot and began the tradition of the annual Royal Ascot procession from the castle. [163] 18th century [ edit ] The North Terrace at sunset c.1790, by Paul Sandby George I took little interest in Windsor Castle, preferring his other palaces at St James's , Hampton Court and Kensington . [164] George II rarely used Windsor either, preferring Hampton Court. [165] Many of the apartments in the Upper Ward were given out as \" grace and favour \" privileges for the use of prominent widows or other friends of the Crown. [166] The Duke of Cumberland made the most use of the property in his role as the Ranger of Windsor Great Park . [167] By the 1740s, Windsor Castle had become an early tourist attraction; wealthier visitors who could afford to pay the castle keeper could enter, see curiosities such as the castle's narwhal horn, and by the 1750s buy the first guidebooks to Windsor, produced by George Bickham in 1753 and Joseph Pote in 1755. [168] [nb 9] As the condition of the State Apartments continued to deteriorate, even the general public were able to regularly visit the property. [170] George III reversed this trend when he came to the throne in 1760. [166] George disliked Hampton Court, and was attracted by the park at Windsor Castle. [166] George wanted to move into the Ranger's House by the castle, but his brother, Henry was already living in it and refused to move out. [171] Instead, George had to move into the Upper Lodge, later called the Queen's Lodge, and started the long process of renovating the castle and the surrounding parks. [171] Initially the atmosphere at the castle remained very informal, with local children playing games inside the Upper and Lower Wards, and the royal family frequently seen as they walked around the grounds. [170] As time went by, however, access for visitors became more limited. [164] George's architectural taste shifted over the years. [172] As a young man, he favoured Classical, in particular Palladian styles, but the king came to favour a more Gothic style, both as a consequence of the Palladian style becoming overused and poorly implemented, and because the Gothic form had come to be seen as a more honest, national style of English design in the light of the French revolution . [173] Working with the architect James Wyatt , George attempted to \"transform the exterior of the buildings in the Upper Ward into a Gothic palace, while retaining the character of the Hugh May state rooms\". [174] The outside of the building was restyled with Gothic features, including new battlements and turrets. [174] Inside, conservation work was undertaken, and several new rooms constructed, including a new Gothic staircase to replace May's 17th-century version, complete with the Grand Vestibule ceiling above it. [175] New paintings were purchased for the castle, and collections from other royal palaces moved there by the king. [176] The cost of the work came to over \u00a3150,000 (\u00a3100\u00a0million in 2008 terms). [177] [178] The king undertook extensive work in the castle's Great Park as well, laying out the new Norfolk and Flemish farms, creating two dairies and restoring Virginia Water Lake , and its grotto and follies . [179] At the end of this period Windsor Castle became a place of royal confinement. In 1788 the king first became ill during a dinner at Windsor Castle; diagnosed as suffering from madness, he was removed for a period to the White House at Kew, where he temporarily recovered. [180] After relapses in 1801 and 1804, his condition became enduring from 1810 onwards and he was confined in the State Apartments of Windsor Castle, with building work on the castle ceasing the following year. [181] 19th century [ edit ] The Lower Ward in 1840, by Joseph Nash , showing the Military Knights attending chapel on a Sunday morning George IV came to the throne in 1820 intending to create a set of royal palaces that reflected his wealth and influence as the ruler of an increasingly powerful Britain. [182] George's previous houses, Carlton House and the Brighton Pavilion were too small for grand court events, even after expensive extensions. [182] George expanded the Royal Lodge in the castle park whilst he was Prince Regent, and then began a programme of work to modernise the castle itself once he became king. [182] George persuaded Parliament to vote him \u00a3300,000 for restoration (\u00a3245\u00a0million in 2008 terms). [95] [178] Under the guidance of George's advisor, Charles Long , the architect Jeffry Wyatville was selected, and work commenced in 1824. [183] [nb 10] Wyatville's own preference ran to Gothic architecture, but George, who had led the reintroduction of the French Rococo style to England at Carlton House, preferred a blend of periods and styles, and applied this taste to Windsor. [184] The terraces were closed off to visitors for greater privacy and the exterior of the Upper Ward was completely remodelled into its current appearance. [185] The Round Tower was raised in height to create a more dramatic appearance; many of the rooms in the State Apartments were rebuilt or remodelled; numerous new towers were created, much higher than the older versions. [186] The south range of the ward was rebuilt to provide private accommodation for the king, away from the state rooms. [187] The statue of Charles II was moved from the centre of the Upper Ward to the base of the motte. [187] Sir Walter Scott captured contemporary views when he noted that the work showed \"a great deal of taste and feeling for the Gothic architecture\"; many modern commentators, including Prince Charles , have criticised Wyatville's work as representing an act of vandalism of May's earlier designs. [188] The work was unfinished at the time of George IV's death in 1830, but was broadly completed by Wyatville's death in 1840. The total expenditure on the castle had soared to the colossal sum of over one million pounds (\u00a3817\u00a0million in 2008 terms) by the end of the project. [95] [178] Queen Victoria and Princess Beatrice in the Queen's Sitting Room in 1895, photographed by Mary Steen Queen Victoria and Prince Albert made Windsor Castle their principal royal residence, despite Victoria complaining early in her reign that the castle was \"dull and tiresome\" and \"prison-like\", and preferring Osborne and Balmoral as holiday residences. [189] The growth of the British Empire and Victoria's close dynastic ties to Europe made Windsor the hub for many diplomatic and state visits, assisted by the new railways and steamships of the period. [190] Indeed, it has been argued that Windsor reached its social peak during the Victorian era, seeing the introduction of invitations to numerous prominent figures to \"dine and sleep\" at the castle. [191] Victoria took a close interest in the details of how Windsor Castle was run, including the minutiae of the social events. [192] Few visitors found these occasions comfortable, both due to the design of the castle and the excessive royal formality. [193] Prince Albert died in the Blue Room at Windsor Castle in 1861 and was buried in the Royal Mausoleum built at nearby Frogmore , within the Home Park . [194] The prince's rooms were maintained exactly as they had been at the moment of his death and Victoria kept the castle in a state of mourning for many years, becoming known as the \" Widow of Windsor \", a phrase popularised in the famous poem by Rudyard Kipling . [195] The Queen shunned the use of Buckingham Palace after Albert's death and instead used Windsor Castle as her residence when conducting official business near London. [196] Towards the end of her reign, plays, operas, and other entertainments slowly began to be held at the castle again, accommodating both the Queen's desire for entertainment and her reluctance to be seen in public. [197] Several minor alterations were made to the Upper Ward under Victoria. Anthony Salvin rebuilt Wyatville's grand staircase, with Edward Blore constructing a new private chapel within the State Apartments. [198] Salvin also rebuilt the State Dining Room following a serious fire in 1853. [199] Ludwig Gruner assisted in the design of the Queen's Private Audience Chamber in the south range. [200] Blore and Salvin also did extensive work in the Lower Ward, under the direction of Prince Albert, including the Hundred Steps leading down into Windsor town, rebuilding the Garter, Curfew and Salisbury towers, the houses of the Military Knights and creating a new Guardhouse. [201] George Gilbert Scott rebuilt the Horseshoe Cloister in the 1870s. [52] The Norman Gatehouse was turned into a private dwelling for Sir Henry Ponsonby . [202] Windsor Castle did not benefit from many of the minor improvements of the era, however, as Victoria disliked gaslight , preferring candles; electric lighting was only installed in limited parts of the castle at the end of her reign. [193] Indeed, the castle was famously cold and draughty in Victoria's reign, [202] but it was connected to a nearby reservoir, with water reliably piped into the interior for the first time. [203] Many of the changes under Victoria were to the surrounding parklands and buildings. The Royal Dairy at Frogmore was rebuilt in a Tudorbethan style in 1853; George III's Dairy rebuilt in a Renaissance style in 1859; the Georgian Flemish Farm rebuilt, and the Norfolk Farm renovated. [204] The Long Walk was planted with fresh trees to replace the diseased stock. [67] The Windsor Castle and Town Approaches Act , passed by Parliament in 1848, permitted the closing and re-routing of the old roads which previously ran through the park from Windsor to Datchet and Old Windsor . [205] These changes allowed the Royal Family to undertake the enclosure of a large area of parkland to form the private \"Home Park\" with no public roads passing through it. [203] The Queen granted additional rights for public access to the remainder of the park as part of this arrangement. [203] 20th century [ edit ] The changing character of the Upper Ward The baroque style of St George's Hall under Charles II The Gothic alterations made by Sir Jeffry Wyatville for George IV The Downesian Gothic reconstruction of the Hall after the 1992 fire Edward VII came to the throne in 1901 and immediately set about modernising Windsor Castle with \"enthusiasm and zest\". [206] Many of the rooms in the Upper Ward were de-cluttered and redecorated for the first time in many years, with Edward \"peering into cabinets; ransacking drawers; clearing rooms formerly used by the Prince Consort and not touched since his death; dispatching case-loads of relics and ornaments to a special room in the Round Tower\u00a0... destroying statues and busts of John Brown ... throwing out hundreds of 'rubbishy old coloured photographs'\u00a0... [and] rearranging pictures\". [207] Electric lighting was added to more rooms, along with central heating ; telephone lines were installed, along with garages for the newly invented automobiles. [208] The marathon was run from Windsor Castle at the 1908 Olympics , and in 1911 the pioneering aviator Thomas Sopwith landed an aircraft at the castle for the first time. [209] [nb 11] George V continued a process of more gradual modernisation, assisted by his wife, Mary of Teck , who had a strong interest in furniture and decoration. [210] Mary sought out and re-acquired items of furniture that had been lost or sold from the castle, including many dispersed by Edward VII, and also acquired many new works of art to furnish the state rooms. [211] Queen Mary was also a lover of all things miniature, and a famous dolls' house was created for her at Windsor Castle, designed by the architect Edwin Lutyens and furnished by leading craftsmen and designers of the 1930s. [212] George V was committed to maintaining a high standard of court life at Windsor Castle, adopting the motto that everything was to be \"of the best\". [213] A large staff was still kept at the castle, with around 660\u00a0servants working in the property during the period. [212] Meanwhile, during the First World War, anti-German feeling led the members of the Royal Family to change their dynastic name from the German House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha ; George decided to take the new name from the castle, and the Royal Family became the House of Windsor in 1917. [214] Edward VIII did not spend much of his reign at Windsor Castle. [214] He continued to spend most of his time at Fort Belvedere in the Great Park , where he had lived whilst Prince of Wales. [214] Edward created a small aerodrome at the castle on Smith's Lawn, now used as a golf-course. [214] Edward's reign was short-lived and he broadcast his abdication speech to the British Empire from the castle in December 1936, adopting the title of Duke of Windsor . [214] His successor, George VI also preferred his own original home, the Royal Lodge in the Great Park, but moved into Windsor Castle with his wife Elizabeth . [214] As king, George revived the annual Garter Service at Windsor, drawing on the accounts of the 17th-century ceremonies recorded by Elias Ashmole , but moving the event to Ascot Week in June. [215] On the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 the castle was readied for war-time conditions. Many of the staff from Buckingham Palace were moved to Windsor for safety, security was tightened and windows were blacked-out. [216] There was significant concern that the castle might be damaged or destroyed during the war; the more important art works were removed from the castle for safe-keeping, the valuable chandeliers were lowered to the floor in case of bomb damage and a sequence of paintings by John Piper were commissioned from 1942\u20134 to record the castle's appearance. [217] The king and queen and their children Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret lived for safety in the castle, with the roof above their rooms specially strengthened in case of attack. [218] The king and queen drove daily to London, returning to Windsor to sleep, although at the time this was a well-kept secret, as for propaganda and morale purposes it was reported that the king was still residing full-time at Buckingham Palace. [218] The castle was also used as a storage facility; for example, the only purified heavy water at the time was rescued from France in the face of the imminent French defeat in 1940, and most of it was sent to the castle to be stored in the basement alongside the Crown Jewels . [219] After the war the king revived the \"dine and sleep\" events at Windsor, following comments that the castle had become \"almost like a vast, empty museum\"; nonetheless, it took many years to restore Windsor Castle to its pre-war condition. [220] In February 1952, Elizabeth II came to the throne and decided to make Windsor her principal weekend retreat. [221] The private apartments which had not been properly occupied since the era of Queen Mary were renovated and further modernised, and the Queen, Prince Philip and their two children took up residence. [221] By the early 1990s, however, there had been a marked deterioration in the quality of the Upper Ward, in particular the State Apartments. [222] Generations of repairs and replacements had resulted in a \"diminution of the richness with which they had first been decorated\", a \"gradual attrition of the original vibrancy of effect, as each change repeated a more faded version of the last\". [223] A programme of repair work to replace the heating and the wiring of the Upper Ward began in 1988. [224] Work was also undertaken to underpin the motte of the Round Tower after fresh subsidence was detected in 1988, threatening the collapse of the tower. [225] 1992 fire [ edit ] Main article: 1992 Windsor Castle fire One of four Queen's Beasts carved by Ben Harms and Ray Gonzalez to replace carvings destroyed in the 1992 fire On 20 November 1992, a major fire occurred at Windsor Castle, lasting for 15 hours and causing widespread damage to the Upper Ward. [226] The Private Chapel in the north-east corner of the State Apartments was being renovated as part of a long term programme of work within the castle, and it is believed that one of the spotlights being used in the work set fire to a curtain by the altar during the morning. [227] The fire spread quickly and destroyed nine of the principal state rooms, and severely damaged more than 100 others. [227] Fire-fighters applied water to contain the blaze, whilst castle staff attempted to rescue the precious artworks from the castle. [228] Many of the rooms closest to the fire had been emptied as part of the renovation work, and this contributed to the successful evacuation of most of the collection. [227] The fire spread through the roof voids and efforts continued through the night to contain the blaze, at great risk to the 200 fire-fighters involved. [229] It was not until late afternoon that the blaze began to come under control, although the fire continued during the night before being officially declared over the next morning. [230] Along with the fire and smoke damage, one of the unintended effects of the fire-fighting was the considerable water damage to the castle; more than 1.5 million gallons of water were used to extinguish it, which in many ways caused more complex restoration problems than the fire. [231] Two major issues for Windsor Castle emerged following the fire. The first was a political debate in Britain as to who should pay for the repairs. [232] Traditionally, as the property of the Crown , Windsor Castle was maintained, and if necessary repaired, by the British government in exchange for the profits made by the Crown Estate . [233] Furthermore, like other occupied royal palaces, it was not insured on grounds of economy. [234] At the time of the fire, however, the British press strongly argued in favour of the Queen herself being required to pay for the repairs from her private income. [232] A solution was found in which the restoration work would be paid for by opening Buckingham Palace to the public at selected times of the year, and by introducing new charges for public access to the parkland surrounding Windsor. [235] The second major issue concerned how to repair the castle. Some suggested that the damaged rooms should be restored to their original appearance, but others favoured repairing the castle so as to incorporate modern designs. [236] The decision was taken to largely follow the pre-fire architecture with some changes to reflect modern tastes and cost, but fresh questions emerged over whether the restoration should be undertaken to \"authentic\" or \"equivalent\" restoration standards. [26] Modern methods were used at Windsor to reproduce the equivalent pre-fire appearance, partially due to the cost. [237] The restoration programme was completed in 1997 at a total cost of \u00a337\u00a0million (\u00a367\u00a0million in 2015 terms). [178] [238] 21st century [ edit ] Windsor Castle is one of Britain's major tourist attractions. Windsor Castle, part of the Occupied Royal Palaces Estate , is owned by Queen Elizabeth\u00a0II in right of the Crown , [239] and day-to-day management is by the Royal Household . [240] In terms of population, Windsor Castle is the largest inhabited castle in the world and the longest-occupied palace in Europe, but it also remains a functioning royal home. [241] As of 2006, around 500 people were living and working in the castle. [242] The Queen has increasingly used the castle as a royal palace as well as her weekend home and it is now as often used for state banquets and official entertaining as Buckingham Palace . [243] In recent years, Windsor Castle has hosted visits from President Mbeki of South Africa, King Abdullah II of Jordan and President Obama of the United States. [244] The castle remains an important ceremonial location. The Waterloo ceremony is carried out in the presence of the Queen each year, and the annual ceremony of the Order of the Garter takes place in St George's Chapel . [245] While the Queen is in residence, the Guard Mounting ceremony occurs on a daily basis. [246] The Royal Ascot procession leaves the castle each year during the annual meeting. [247] During the Queen's tenure much has been done, not only to restore and maintain the fabric of the building, but also to transform it into a major British tourist attraction, containing a significant portion of the Royal Collection of art, which is managed from Windsor. Archaeological work has continued at the castle , following on from limited investigations in the 1970s, the work on the Round Tower from 1988\u201392 and the investigations following the 1992 fire. [248] During 2007, 993,000 tourists visited the castle. [249] This has had to be achieved in co-ordination with security issues and the castle's role as a working royal palace. [240] In late 2011 two large water turbines were installed upstream of the castle on the River Thames to provide hydroelectric power to the castle and the surrounding estate. [250] In April 2016 it was announced that the Royal Collection Trust is to fund a \u00a327m project that will reinstate the original entrance hall of the castle to visitors, as well as a new cafe that will be housed in the 14th Century undercroft. The project is scheduled for completion at the end of 2018, and will include a visitor centre and a dedicated learning centre.

{"question": "list of environmentally critical areas in the philippines", "answer": "", "context": "List of protected areas of the Philippines - Wikipedia List of protected areas of the Philippines From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search Map of the Philippine archipelago This is a list of protected areas of the Philippines administered by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources' Biodiversity Management Bureau under the National Integrated Protected Areas System (NIPAS) Act of 1992. As of 2012, there are 240 protected areas in the Philippines covering a total area of 35,700 square kilometres (13,800\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) \u2013 11.9% of the Philippines' total land area.

This act authorized the Civil Governor to \"reserve for civil public purposes, and from sale or settlement, any part of the public domain not appropriated by law for special public purposes.\" [2] A total of eight national reserves had been established on July 26, 1904 pursuant to this law. These are: Lamao Forest Reserve in Bataan , Mariquina Reserve in Rizal , Angat River Reserve in Bulacan , Caliraya Falls Reserve in Laguna , La Carlota Reserve in Negros Occidental , San Ramon Reserve in Zamboanga , Magalang Reserve in Pampanga , and Hacienda San Antonio in Isabela . [3] In the same year, the Forest Act of 1904 ( Act No. 1148 ) was adopted that expanded the scope of protected areas in the Philippines. [4] Among the first of such mountain forest reserves to be declared was Mount Maquiling declared on November 21, 1910. [5] On February 1, 1932, the National Parks Act ( Act No. 3195 ) was enacted that formally established the national parks system in the country. [6] Mount Arayat became the first national park in the Philippines established on June 27, 1933 following this act. A series of acts and legislations were passed in the next decades that aimed to further strengthen these policies, including the Revised Forestry Code of 1975 ( Presidential Decree No. 705 ) and Forest Administrative Order No. 7. Following the 1987 Constitution , the National Integrated Protected Areas System Act was enacted which further enhanced the administration and classification of protected areas, and broadened the mandate of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources in enforcing its provisions. Classification [ edit ] Protected areas in the Philippines are managed according to the following classifications described in Section 4 of the National Integrated Protected Areas System Act of 1992 (NIPAS Act). National Parks [ edit ] Main article: List of national parks of the Philippines National parks refer to forest reservations essentially of natural wilderness character which have been withdrawn from settlement, occupancy or any form of exploitation except in conformity with approved management plan and set aside as such exclusively to conserve the area or preserve the scenery, the natural and historic objects, wild animals and plants therein and to provide enjoyment of these features in such areas. Natural Parks [ edit ] Natural parks are relatively large areas not materially altered by human activity where extractive resource uses are not allowed and maintained to protect outstanding natural and scenic areas of national or international significance for scientific, educational and recreational use.

{"question": "after the bath woman drying herself elements of design", "answer": "", "context": "After the Bath, Woman Drying Herself - Wikipedia After the Bath, Woman Drying Herself From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search Edgar Degas , After the Bath, Woman drying herself , 1890\u201395, National Gallery, London After the Bath, Woman drying herself is a pastel drawing by Edgar Degas , made about 1890\u201395. It has been in the collection of the National Gallery, London since 1959. [1] The work is part of a series of drawings, preliminary sketches and completed works in pastels and oils by Degas from this period that depict women bathing. Contents [ hide ] 1 Artwork 2 History 3 Influences 4 Painting materials 5 Notes 6 References Artwork [ edit ] After the Bath, Woman Drying Her Hair Woman Drying Herself The work depicts a woman sitting on white towels spread over a wicker chair, with her back to the viewer. Her body is arched and slightly twisted, creating a tension in her back, accentuated by the deep line of her backbone. One hand dries her neck with a towel, presumably after getting out of the tin bath in the corner of the room. The other arm leans out to hold onto the chair for support. The space is defined by the vertical and diagonal lines where the floor and walls meet. [2] The drawing was made on several pieces of paper mounted on cardboard. Degas may have started with a smaller composition which he extended as he worked, requiring more paper. [3] The heavily worked pastel creates deep textures and blurred contours, emphasising the figure's movement. The artwork measures 103.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a098.5 centimetres (40.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a038.8\u00a0in). [1] History [ edit ] After the Bath, Woman Drying Her Back (1896) (The J. Paul Getty Museum) Edgar Degas often used photographs and sketches as a preliminary step, studying the light and the composition for his paintings. The work is part of a series of photographs, preliminary sketches and completed works in pastels and oils by Degas from this period. The series depict women dancing or bathing, [2] some showing women in awkward unnatural positions. [4] Degas, speaking about these works, said, he intended to create a feeling in the viewer: \"as if you looked through a keyhole.\" [2] Degas included many works of female nudes bathing in the last Impressionist exhibition in 1886. [5] Nine of Degas' pastel drawings of women at their bath were exhibited by Theo Van Gogh at Galerie Boussod et Valadon in 1888. [2] The work was shown at the Lefevre Gallery in 1950 and was bought for the collection of the National Gallery, London in 1959. [6] A less highly worked example of a similar subject is in the Courtauld Gallery , [7] and other works in the series are in many public museums.

Influences [ edit ] The work had a considerable influence on Francis Bacon , most noticeably on his triptychs Three Figures in a Room (1964, Centre Pompidou, Paris) and Three Studies of the Male Back (1970, Kunsthaus Z\u00fcrich). [6] The Tate Gallery says \"For Bacon [it] was indeed something of a talisman. It epitomised Degas's approach to a larger obsession the two artists shared with the plasticity of the body, its potential for the most varied forms of articulation, in movement and repose.\" The work was one of three central nudes chosen by Bacon in his \"The Artist's Choice\" exhibition at the National Gallery in 1985, shown between Vel\u00e1zquez 's Rokeby Venus and Michelangelo 's Entombment . Art historian and curator Michael Peppiatt quoted Bacon thus: \"I love Degas. I think his pastels are among the greatest things ever made. I think they're far greater than his paintings.\" [6] Painting materials [ edit ] The analysis of the painting materials is described in the book by Bomford et al. [8] Degas used a multitude of commercially available pastel crayons many of which consisted of several individual pigments. Predominant pigments in this painting are Prussian blue , cadmium yellow and ochres .

{"question": "what\u2019s the difference between downhill and super g", "answer": "", "context": "Super-G - Wikipedia Super-G From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search \"Super G\" redirects here. For other uses, see Super G (disambiguation) . Austrian alpine skier competing in super-G Super giant slalom , or super-G , is a racing discipline of alpine skiing . Along with the faster downhill , it is regarded as a \"speed\" event, in contrast to the technical events giant slalom and slalom . It debuted as an official World Cup event during the 1983 season and was added to the official schedule of the World Championships in 1987 and the Winter Olympics in 1988 . Much like downhill, the other of the two \"speed\" events in alpine skiing, a super-G course consists of widely set gates that racers must pass through. The course is set so that skiers must turn more than in downhill, though the speeds are still much higher than in giant slalom (hence the name). Each athlete only has one run to clock the best time. In the Olympics, super-G courses are usually set on the same slopes as the downhill, but with a lower starting point. Contents [ hide ] 1 History 1.1 Top racers 2 Course 3 Equipment 3.1 Men's World Cup podiums 3.2 Super G at the major competitions 4 See also 5 References 6 External links History [ edit ] Super-G was run as a World Cup test event during the 1982 season, with two men's races and a women's race that did not count in the season standings. [1] Approved by the International Ski Federation (FIS) that summer, it was first officially run at the World Cup level in December 1982 at Val-d'Is\u00e8re , France ; the winner was Peter M\u00fcller of Switzerland. The first official women's super-G was run a month later in early January 1983, with consecutive events at Verbier , Switzerland. The first winner was Irene Epple of West Germany , and Cindy Nelson of the United States won the next day on a different course. [2] These were the only two races for women in super-G during the 1983 season; the men had three. The event was not universally embraced during its early years, [3] which included a boycott by two-time defending overall champion Phil Mahre in December 1982. [4] [5] For the first three seasons, super-G results were added into the giant slalom discipline for the season standings; it gained separate status for a crystal globe for the 1986 season with five events for both men and women; the first champions were Markus Wasmeier and Marina Kiehl , both of West Germany . It was added to the World Championships in 1987 , held at Crans-Montana , Switzerland. Swiss skiers Pirmin Zurbriggen and Maria Walliser won gold medals to become the first world champions in the event. Super-G made its Olympic debut in 1988 in Calgary , where Franck Piccard of France and Sigrid Wolf of Austria took gold at Nakiska . Top racers [ edit ] Hermann Maier of Austria (nicknamed 'The Hermannator') is widely regarded as the greatest male super-G racer, with 24 World Cup victories and five World Cup titles ( 1998 \u2013 2001 , 2004 ). He won the world championship in 1999 and an Olympic gold medal in 1998 , three days after a crash in the downhill. Maier's proficiency in super-G was attributed to his thorough course inspection and his aggressive course tactics; he opted for the most direct and dangerous line down the hill. A serious motorcycle accident in August 2001 nearly resulted in an amputation of his lower right leg and sidelined him for the 2002 season, including the 2002 Olympics . After his return to the World Cup circuit in January 2003 , Maier won eight more World Cup super-G events and his fifth season title in 2004. Aksel Lund Svindal of Norway is second on the list with 15 wins in World Cup super-G races, Pirmin Zurbriggen third with his 10 wins. Svindal won Olympic gold in 2010 and his fifth season title in 2014 , while Zurbriggen won four consecutive season titles ( 1987 \u2013 90 ) and the first world championship in 1987. Another notable specialist was Kjetil Andr\u00e9 Aamodt of Norway, a triple gold medalist in Olympic super-G races, winning in 1992 , 2002 and 2006 . Aamodt won five World Cup races and two world championship medals (silver and bronze) in the discipline. Marc Girardelli of Luxembourg , a five-time overall World Cup champion, won nine World Cup super-G events. He won season titles in every discipline except super-G, where he was a runner-up three times. Girardelli was the silver medalist in the super-G at the 1987 World Championships and the 1992 Olympics . On the women's side, Lindsey Vonn of the U.S. leads with 27 World Cup victories in super-G and has won five season titles ( 2009 \u2013 2012 , 2015 ). Katja Seizinger of Germany won five season titles in the 1990s, with 16 World Cup wins in the discipline. While neither won gold in the super-G in the Olympics (both won a bronze), they both won a world title , Vonn in 2009 and Seizinger in 1993 . Renate G\u00f6tschl of Austria won 17 World Cup events in super-G, three season titles (four as runner-up), and two medals (silver and bronze) in the world championships. Course [ edit ] The vertical drop for a Super-G course must be between 350\u2013650\u00a0m (1,150\u20132,130\u00a0ft) for men, 350\u2013600\u00a0m (1,150\u20131,970\u00a0ft) for women, and 250\u2013450\u00a0m (820\u20131,480\u00a0ft) for children. In the Olympic Winter Games, FIS World Ski Championships, and FIS World Cups, minimums are raised to 400\u00a0m (1,300\u00a0ft) for both men and women. Courses are normally at least 30\u00a0m (98\u00a0ft) in width, but sections with lower widths are permissible if the line and terrain before and after allow it. Higher widths can also be required if deemed necessary. Gates must be between 6\u00a0m (20\u00a0ft) and 8\u00a0m (26\u00a0ft) in width for open gates, and between 8\u00a0m (26\u00a0ft) and 12\u00a0m (39\u00a0ft) in width for vertical gates. The distance between turning poles of successive gates must be at least 25\u00a0m (82\u00a0ft). The number of direction changes must be at least 7% of the course drop in meters (6% for Olympic Winter Games, FIS World Ski Championships and FIS World Cups). [6] Equipment [ edit ] In an attempt to increase safety, the 2004 season saw the FIS impose minimum ski lengths for the super-G for the first time; to 205\u00a0cm (80.7\u00a0in) for men, 200\u00a0cm (78.7\u00a0in) for women. The minimum turning radius was increased to 45\u00a0m (148\u00a0ft) for the 2014 season.

Recognised in 2015 by the Swiss authorities as an \"other international body\" under Switzerland's Host State Act 2007 (HSA, SR 192.12), [1] its mission is cited as \"committed to improving the state of the world by engaging business, political, academic, and other leaders of society to shape global, regional, and industry agendas\". The forum is best known for its annual meeting at the end of January in Davos , a mountain resort in Graub\u00fcnden , in the eastern Alps region of Switzerland. The meeting brings together some 2,500 top business leaders, international political leaders, economists , celebrities and journalists for up to four days to discuss the most pressing issues facing the world . Often this location alone is used to identify meetings, participation, and participants, with such phrases as \"a Davos panel\" and \"Davos man\" being used. [2] The organization also convenes some six to eight regional meetings each year in locations across Africa, East Asia, and Latin America, and holds two further annual meetings in China, India and the United Arab Emirates . Beside meetings, the foundation produces a series of research reports and engages its members in sector-specific initiatives.

F. W. de Klerk and Nelson Mandela shake hands at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum held in Davos in January 1992 Naoto Kan , then Japanese prime minister gives a special message at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2011 Klaus Schwab , founder and executive chairman, World Economic Forum Carlos Ghosn , the chairman and CEO of Renault , Nissan , Renault-Nissan Alliance and the Chairman of AvtoVAZ The forum was founded in 1971 by Klaus Schwab , a German-born business professor at the University of Geneva . [4] First named the \"European Management Forum\", it changed its name to the World Economic Forum in 1987 and sought to broaden its vision to include providing a platform for resolving international conflicts. In the summer of 1971, Schwab invited 444 executives from Western European firms to the first European Management Symposium held in the Davos Congress Centre under the patronage of the European Commission and European industrial associations, where Schwab sought to introduce European firms to American management practices. He then founded the WEF as a nonprofit organization based in Geneva and drew European business leaders to Davos for the annual meetings each January. [5] Schwab developed the \"stakeholder\" management approach , which attributed corporate success to managers actively taking account of all interests: not merely shareholders , clients, and customers, but also employees and the communities within which the firm is situated, including governments. [6] Events in 1973, including the collapse of the Bretton Woods fixed-exchange rate mechanism and the Arab\u2013Israeli War , saw the annual meeting expand its focus from management to economic and social issues, and, for the first time, political leaders were invited to the annual meeting in January 1974. [7] Political leaders soon began to use the annual meeting as a neutral platform. The Davos Declaration was signed in 1988 by Greece and Turkey, helping them turn back from the brink of war. In 1992, South African President F. W. de Klerk met with Nelson Mandela and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi at the annual meeting, their first joint appearance outside South Africa. At the 1994 annual meeting, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and PLO chairman Yasser Arafat reached a draft agreement on Gaza and Jericho . [8] In late 2015, the invitation was extended to include a North Korean delegation for the 2016 forum, \"in view of positive signs coming out of the country,\" the WEF organizers noted. North Korea has not been attending the WEF since 1998. The invitation was accepted but after the January 2016 North Korean nuclear test on 6 January, the invitation was revoked, and the country's delegation was made subject to \"existing and possible forthcoming sanctions.\" [9] Despite protests by North Korea calling the decision by the WEF managing board a \"sudden and irresponsible\" move, the WEF committee maintained the exclusion because \"under these circumstances there would be no opportunity for international dialogue.\" [10] In 2017, the World Economic Forum in Davos attracted considerable attention when for the first time, a head of state from the People's Republic of China was present at the alpine resort. With the backdrop of Brexit , an incoming protectionist US administration and significant pressures on free trade zones and trade agreements , President Xi Jinping defended the global economic scheme, and portrayed China as a responsible nation and a leader for environmental causes. He sharply rebuked the current populist movements that would introduce tariffs and hinder global commerce, warning that such protectionism could foster isolation and reduced economic opportunity. [11] In 2018, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave the plenary speech becoming the first head of state from India to deliver the inaugural keynote for the annual meet at Davos. Modi highlighted climate change, terrorism and protectionism as the three major global challenges, and expressed confidence that they can be tackled with collective effort. [12] Organization [ edit ] Headquartered in Cologny, the forum also has offices in New York, Beijing and Tokyo. On October 10, 2016, the Forum announced the opening of its new Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution in San Francisco. According to the Forum, the center will \"serve as a platform for interaction, insight and impact on the scientific and technological changes that are changing the way we live, work and relate to one another\". [13] The World Economic Forum strives to be impartial and is not tied to any political, partisan , or national interests. The foundation is \"committed to improving the State of the World\". [14] Until 2012, it had observer status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council ; it is under the supervision of the Swiss Federal Council . The foundation's highest governance body is the foundation board. [15] Erdo\u011fan walks out of the session at the World Economic Forum in 2009. During its annual meeting, more than 2,500 participants from slightly fewer than 100 countries gather in Davos. Approximately 1,500 are business leaders, [ citation needed ] drawn from its members, 1,000 of the world's top companies. Besides these, participants included 219 public figures, including 40 heads of state or government, 64 cabinet ministers, 30 heads or senior officials of international organizations, and 10 ambassadors. More than 432 participants were from civil society, including 32 heads or representatives of non-governmental organizations, 225 media leaders, 149 leaders from academic institutions and think tanks, 15 religious leaders of different faiths, and 11 union leaders. [16] [ not in citation given ] Membership [ edit ] The foundation is funded by its 1,000 member companies, typically global enterprises with more than five billion dollars in turnover (varying by industry and region). These enterprises rank among the top companies within their industry and/or country and play a leading role in shaping the future of their industry and/or region. Membership is stratified by the level of engagement with forum activities, with the level of membership fees increasing as participation in meetings, projects, and initiatives rises. [17] As of 2011, an annual membership costs $52,000 for an individual member, $263,000 for \"Industry Partner\" and $527,000 for \"Strategic Partner\". An admission fee costs $19,000 per person. [18] In 2014, WEF raised annual fees by 20 percent, making the cost for \"Strategic Partner\" from CHF 500,000 ($523,000) to CHF 600,000 ($628,000). [19] Activities [ edit ] Annual meeting in Davos [ edit ] A sports shop has turned into a temporary informal reception location \"Caspian week\", WEF 2018. The flagship event of the foundation is the invitation-only annual meeting held during the winter at the end of January in Davos, Switzerland, bringing together chief executive officers from its 1,000 member companies, as well as selected politicians, representatives from academia , NGOs , religious leaders, and the media in an alpine winter environment. The town is small enough to allow participants to meet anywhere outside the sessions and allows them the greatest opportunities to attend receptions organized by companies and countries. [20] The participants are also taking part in role playing events, such as the Investment Heat Map. [21] Informal winter meetings may have led to as many ideas and solutions as the official sessions. [22] Approximately 2,200 participants gather for the five-day event and attend some of the 220 sessions in the official programme. The winter discussions focus around key issues of global concern (such as the globalization , capital markets, wealth management, international conflicts, environmental problems and their possible solutions). [3] As many as 500 journalists from online, print, radio, and television take part, with access to all sessions in the official program, some of which are also webcast . [23] Not all the journalists are given access to all areas, however. This is reserved for white badge holders. \"Davos runs an almost caste-like system of badges,\" according to BBC journalist Anthony Reuben. \"A white badge means you're one of the delegates \u2013 you might be the chief executive of a company or the leader of a country (although that would also get you a little holographic sticker to add to your badge), or a senior journalist. An orange badge means you're just a run-of-the-mill working journalist.\" [24] All plenary debates from the annual meeting also are available on YouTube, [25] with photographs at Flickr , [26] [27] Year Dates Theme 1988 The New State of the World Economy 1989 Key Developments in the 90s: Implications for Global Business 1990 Competitive Cooperation in a Decade of Turbulence 1991 The New Direction for Global Leadership 1992 Global Cooperation and Megacompetition 1993 Rallying all the forces for Global Recovery 1994 Redefining the Basic Assumptions of the World Economy 1995 Leadership for Challenges beyond Growth 1996 Sustaining Globalization 1997 Building the Network Society 1998 Managing Volatility and Priorities for the 21st Century 1999 Responsible Globality: Managing the impact of Globalization 2000 New Beginnings: Making a difference 2001 25\u201330 January Sustaining Growth and Bridging the Divides: A Framework for Our Global Future 2002 Leadership in Fragile Times 2003 21\u201325 January Building Trust 2004 Partnering for Security and Prosperity 2005 26\u201330 January Taking Responsibility for Tough Choices 2006 25\u201329 January The Creative Imperative 2007 24\u201328 January Shaping the Global Agenda, The Shifting Power Equation 2008 23\u201327 January The Power of Collaborative Innovation 2009 28 January \u2013 1 February Shaping the Post-Crisis World 2010 27\u201330 January Improve the State of the World: Rethink, Redesign, Rebuild 2011 26\u201330 January Shared Norms for the New Reality 2012 25\u201329 January The Great Transformation: Shaping New Models 2013 23\u201327 January Resilient Dynamism [28] 2014 22\u201325 January The Reshaping of the World: Consequences for Society, Politics and Business. 2015 21\u201324 January New global context 2016 20\u201323 January Mastering the Fourth Industrial Revolution 2017 17\u201320 January Responsive and Responsible Leadership 2018 23\u201326 January Creating a Shared Future in a Fractured World Participants [ edit ] Juan Manuel Santos , president of Colombia , at the 2010 World Economic Forum In 2011, some 250 public figures (heads of state or government, cabinet ministers, ambassadors, heads or senior officials of international organizations) attended the annual meeting, including: Felipe Calder\u00f3n , Robert B.

[29] Al Gore , Bill Clinton , Bill Gates , Bono , Paulo Coelho , and Tony Blair also are regular Davos attendees. Past attendees include Recep Tayyip Erdogan , Henry Kissinger , Nelson Mandela , Raymond Barre , Julian Lloyd Webber , Sandro Salsano , Wences Casares , and Yasser Arafat . Summer annual meeting [ edit ] Wang Jianlin , Chairman of the Dalian Wanda Group , at the 2009 Annual Meeting of the New Champions in Dalian In 2007, the foundation established the Annual Meeting of the New Champions (also called Summer Davos), held annually in China, alternating between Dalian and Tianjin , bringing together 1,500 participants from what the foundation calls Global Growth Companies, primarily from rapidly growing emerging countries such as China, India , Russia, Mexico , and Brazil , but also including quickly growing companies from developed countries . The meeting also engages with the next generation of global leaders from fast-growing regions and competitive cities, as well as technology pioneers from around the globe. [30] [31] The Chinese Premier has delivered a plenary address at each annual meeting. Regional meetings [ edit ] Prithviraj Chavan , chief minister of Maharashtra India; Sudha Pilay, member secretary, planning commission, India; and Ben Verwaayen , chief executive officer, Alcatel-Lucent, France were the co-chairs of the India Economic Summit 2011 in Mumbai Felipe Calder\u00f3n , president of Mexico , speaking during Latin America Broadens Its Horizons , a session at the 2007 annual meeting of the World Economic Forum Every year regional meetings take place, enabling close contact among corporate business leaders, local government leaders, and NGOs. Meetings are held in Africa, East Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. The mix of hosting countries varies from year to year, but consistently China and India have hosted throughout the decade since 2000. [32] Young Global Leaders [ edit ] The group's Forum of Young Global Leaders [33] consists of 800 people chosen by the forum organizers as being representative of contemporary leadership, \"coming from all regions of the world and representing all stakeholders in society\", according to the organization. After five years of participation they are considered alumni. Social Entrepreneurs [ edit ] Since 2000, the WEF has been promoting models developed by those in close collaboration with the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship , [34] highlighting social entrepreneurship as a key element to advance societies and address social problems. [35] [36] Selected social entrepreneurs are invited to participate in the foundation's regional meetings and the annual meetings where they may meet chief executives and senior government officials. At the Annual Meeting 2003, for example, Jeroo Billimoria met with Roberto Blois, deputy secretary-general of the International Telecommunication Union , an encounter that produced a key partnership for her organization Child helpline international . [37] Global Shapers [ edit ] Logo of the Global Shapers Community In 2011, the World Economic Forum started a global network of people between the ages of 20 and 33 (30 at the time of nomination) who have shown great potential for future leadership roles in society. [38] The proposal was led by the executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, Professor Klaus Schwab . [39] The Community of Global Shapers , [40] highlighting Global Shapers , is a network of self-organizing local hubs based in each major city around the world. They undertake events and activities intended by the Global Shapers to generate a positive impact within their local community. As of 11 July 2016 there are 459 Hubs with more than 6,100 Shapers. [41] As of 26 June 2016 there are 459 Hubs with more than 6,216 Shapers. [ citation needed ] Hubs undertake events and activities that generate a positive impact within their local community. The community is vitalized by the manifold interactions generated inside each hub, between hubs and on a global level. Shapers also get involved in crossmentoring with other World Economic Forum communities. Thirst [ edit ] \"Thirst\" is an international non-profit organization based in Beijing, China. It was set up in 2011 through the Water Security Council of the World Economic Forum. The organization educates 14\u201324-year olds about the idea of embedded water, the water crisis, and sustainable water usage. [42] Research reports [ edit ] Two Academy Award winner, Pakistani journalist Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy at the forum in 2013 The foundation also acts as a think tank , publishing a wide range of reports. In particular, \"Strategic Insight Teams\" focus on producing reports of relevance in the fields of competitiveness, global risks, and scenario thinking . Filipino businessman Z\u00f3bel de Ayala at the forum in 2009 The \"Competitiveness Team\" [43] produces a range of annual economic reports (first published in brackets): the Global Competitiveness Report (1979) measured competitiveness of countries and economies; The Global Information Technology Report (2001) assessed their competitiveness based on their IT readiness; the Global Gender Gap Report examined critical areas of inequality between men and women; the Global Risks Report (2006) assessed key global risks; the Global Travel and Tourism Report (2007) measured travel and tourism competitiveness; the Financial Development Report (2008) [44] aimed to provide a comprehensive means for countries to establish benchmarks for various aspects of their financial systems and establish priorities for improvement; and the Global Enabling Trade Report (2008) presented a cross-country analysis of the large number of measures facilitating trade among nations. [45] The \"Risk Response Network\" [46] produces a yearly report assessing risks which are deemed to be within the scope of these teams, have cross-industry relevance, are uncertain, have the potential to cause upwards of US$10\u00a0billion in economic damage, have the potential to cause major human suffering, and which require a multi-stakeholder approach for mitigation. [47] Initiatives [ edit ] The Global Health Initiative was launched by Kofi Annan at the annual meeting in 2002. The GHI's mission was to engage businesses in public-private partnerships to tackle HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis , malaria , and health systems. Mohammad Khatami at Economic Forum in 2004 The Global Education Initiative (GEI), launched during the annual meeting in 2003, brought together international IT companies and governments in Jordan, Egypt, and India [48] that has resulted in new personal computer hardware being available in their classrooms and more local teachers trained in e-learning . This is having a significant effect on the lives of children. [ citation needed ] The GEI model, which is scalable and sustainable, now is being used as an educational blueprint in other countries including Rwanda . The Environmental Initiative covers climate change and water issues. Under the Gleneagles Dialogue on Climate Change , the U.K. government asked the World Economic Forum at the G8 Summit in Gleneagles in 2005 to facilitate a dialogue with the business community to develop recommendations for reducing greenhouse gas emissions . This set of recommendations, endorsed by a global group of CEOs, was presented to leaders ahead of the G8 Summit in Toyako and Hokkaido held in July 2008. [49] [50] The Water Initiative brings together diverse stakeholders such as Alcan Inc. , the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation , USAID India, UNDP India, Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Government of Rajasthan , and the NEPAD Business Foundation to develop public-private partnerships on water management in South Africa and India. In an effort to combat corruption, the Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI) was launched by CEOs from the Engineering and Construction, Energy and Metals , and Mining industries at the annual meeting in Davos during January 2004. PACI is a platform for peer exchange on practical experience and dilemma situations. Approximately 140 companies have joined the initiative. [51] The Environment and Natural Resource Security Initiative was emphasized for the 2017 meeting to achieve inclusive economic growth and sustainable practices for global industries. With increasing limitations on world trade through national interests and trade barriers, the WEF has moved towards a more sensitive and socially minded approach for global businesses with a focus on the reduction of carbon emissions in China and other large industrial nations. [52] On 19 January 2017 the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a global initiative to fight epidemics, was launched at the forum in Davos. The internationally funded initiative aims at securing vaccine supplies for global emergencies and pandemics, and to research new vaccines for tropical diseases, that are now more menacing. The project is funded by private and governmental donors, with an initial investment of US$460m from the governments of Germany, Japan and Norway, plus the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust. [53] Also in 2017, WEF launched the Fourth Industrial Revolution ( 4IR ) for the Earth Initiative, a collaboration among WEF, Stanford University and PwC , and funded through the Mava Foundation. [54] In 2018, WEF announced that one project within this initiative was to be the Earth BioGenome Project, the aim of which is to sequence the genomes of every organism on Earth. [55] Awards [ edit ] Technology Pioneers Programme [ edit ] The Technology Pioneers Programme recognizes companies that are designing and developing new technologies. The award is given to 30\u201350 companies each year. Since 2000, Technology Pioneers have consisted of more than 400 companies from 5 continents. The Tech Pioneers are integrated into programme activities with the objective to identify and address future-oriented issues on the global agenda in proactive, innovative, and entrepreneurial ways. By bringing these executives together with scientists, academics, NGOs, and foundation members and partners, the foundation's goal is to shed new light on how technologies may be used to address, for example, finding new vaccines, creating economic growth, and enhancement of global communication. [56] Criticism [ edit ] Protest march against the WEF in Basel , 2006. The Transnational Institute describes the World Economic Forum's main purpose as being \"to function as a socializing institution for the emerging global elite , globalization 's \"Mafiocracy\" of bankers , industrialists , oligarchs , technocrats and politicians. They promote common ideas, and serve common interests: their own.\" [57] A study, published in the Journal of Consumer Research , investigated the sociological impact of the WEF. It concluded that the WEF do not solve issues such as poverty , global warming , chronic illness , or debt . They have simply shifted the burden for the solution of these problems from governments and business to \"responsible consumers subjects: the green consumer, the health-conscious consumer, and the financially literate consumer.\" They merely reframe the issues, and by so doing perpetuate them. Gore is singled out as a prime example. Gore's speeches deliberately shift focus away from the problems of unregulated markets and corporate activities to one of moral pathologies, individual greed, etc. In doing so he is actually promoting the creation of new markets, and hence perpetuating the same old problems in a new guise. New markets will follow the same patterns as the old ones because the core problem of corporate governance is never addressed. [58] History of criticism [ edit ] During the late 1990s the foundation, along with the G7 , World Bank , World Trade Organization , and International Monetary Fund , came under heavy criticism by anti-globalization activists who claimed that capitalism and globalization were increasing poverty and destroying the environment. Ten thousand demonstrators disrupted the World Economic Forum in Melbourne , obstructing the path of two hundred delegates to the meeting. [59] Repeatedly, demonstrations are held in Davos (see Anti-WEF protests in Switzerland, January 2003 ) to protest against what have been called the meetings of \"fat cats in the snow\", a tongue-in-cheek term used by rock singer Bono. [60] After 2014, the protest movement against the World Economic Forum has largely died down, and Swiss police noted a significant decline in attending protesters, 20 at most during the meeting in 2016. While protesters are still more numerous in large Swiss cities, the protest movement itself has undergone significant change. [61] Around 150 Tibetans and Uighurs protested in Geneva and 400 Tibetans in Bern against the visit of the Chinese president for the 2017 meeting, with subsequent confrontations and arrests. [62] Public cost of security [ edit ] In January 2000, a thousand protesters marched through the streets of Davos and smashed the window of the local McDonald's restaurant. [63] The tight security measures around the campus of Davos have kept demonstrators from the Alpine resort, and most demonstrations were held in Z\u00fcrich , Bern , or Basel . [64] The costs of the security measures, which are shared by the foundation and the Swiss cantonal and national authorities, have been criticized in the Swiss national media. [65] [66] Private vs public meetings [ edit ] Since the annual meeting in January 2003 in Davos, an Open Forum Davos , [67] co-organized by the Federation of Swiss Protestant Churches , is held concurrently with the Davos forum, opening up the debate about globalization to the general public. The Open Forum has been held in the local high school every year, featuring top politicians and business leaders. It is open to all members of the public free of charge. [68] [69] The annual meeting of the forum also has been decried as a \"mix of pomp and platitude\" and criticized for moving away from serious economics and accomplishing little of substance, particularly with the increasing involvement of NGOs that have little or no expertise in economics. Instead of a discussion on the world economy with knowledgeable experts alongside key business and political players, the annual meeting of the forum now features the top political topics of the day appearing in media, such as global climate change and AIDS in Africa. [70] Influence of financial supporters [ edit ] Faculty member Steven Strauss at the Harvard Kennedy School , has raised an additional concern, pointing out that many of the WEF's strategic partners (who in return for financing the annual meeting have the ability to set the intellectual agenda for the meeting) have been convicted of serious criminal, civil, or human rights violations, raising significant issues about the forum's legitimacy as a neutral convener on certain topics. [71] Public Eye Awards [ edit ] The Public Eye Award , a former counter-event to the WEF. The Public Eye Awards have been held every year since 2000. It is a counter-event to the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos. Public Eye Awards is a public competition of the worst corporations in the world. In 2011, more than 50,000 people voted for companies that acted irresponsibly. At a ceremony at a Davos hotel, the \"winners\" in 2011 were named as Indonesian palm oil diesel maker, Neste Oil in Finland, and mining company AngloGold Ashanti in South Africa. [72] According to Schweiz aktuell broadcast on 16 January 2015, a public presence during the WEF 2015, may not be guaranteed because the massively increased security in Davos. The Public Eye Award will be awarded for the last time in Davos: Public Eyes says Goodbye to Davos , confirmed by Rolf Marugg (now Landrats politician), by not directly engaged politicians, and by the police responsible. [73] \"Davos Man\" [ edit ] \"Davos Man\" is a neologism referring to the global elite of wealthy (predominantly) men, whose members view themselves as completely \"international\". Davos men supposedly see their identity as a matter of personal choice, not an accident of birth. According to political scientist Samuel P. Huntington , who is credited with inventing the phrase \"Davos Man\", [74] they are people who \"have little need for national loyalty, view national boundaries as obstacles that thankfully are vanishing, and see national governments as residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the \u00e9lite's global operations\". In his 2004 article \"Dead Souls: The Denationalization of the American Elite\", Huntington argues that this international perspective is a minority elitist position not shared by the nationalist majority of the people. [75] John Fonte of the Hudson Institute has suggested that the transnational ideology of Davos Man represents a major challenge to Francis Fukuyama 's assertion that liberal democracy represents the fulfillment of The End of History and the Last Man . [76] Gender debate [ edit ] Since 2011, the World Economic Forum has been addressing its very own gender quota , to introduce at least one woman for every five senior executives that attended. With apparent success, female participation increased significantly from 9% to 15% between 2001 and 2005. In 2016, 18% of the WEF attendees were female, this number increased to 21% in 2017. [77] Stateless elitism erosion [ edit ] Hernando de Soto Polar of the Institute for Liberty and Democracy attributes a similar concept to Fernand Braudel , [78] referring to it as the \"bell jar\". Although internationally connected, each country's elite lives in a bell jar in the sense of being out of touch with its own populace. Their isolation fosters a tendency to be oblivious to the fate of their fellow citizens. [79] Lawrence Summers refers to this concept as the \"stateless elites\", tied more to the success of the global economy than to any nation, and views it as eroding support for continuing globalization.

Comprising Redwood National Park (established 1968) and California's Del Norte Coast , Jedediah Smith , and Prairie Creek Redwoods State Parks (dating from the 1920s), the combined RNSP contain 139,000 acres (560\u00a0km 2 ), [3] and feature old-growth temperate rainforests . Located entirely within Del Norte and Humboldt Counties , the four parks, together, protect 45% of all remaining coast redwood ( Sequoia sempervirens ) old-growth forests, totaling at least 38,982 acres (157.75\u00a0km 2 ). These trees are the tallest and one of the most massive tree species on Earth. In addition to the redwood forests, the parks preserve other indigenous flora , fauna , grassland prairie , cultural resources, portions of rivers and other streams, and 37 miles (60\u00a0km) of pristine coastline. In 1850, old-growth redwood forest covered more than 2,000,000 acres (8,100\u00a0km 2 ) of the California coast. The northern portion of that area, originally inhabited by Native Americans , attracted many lumbermen and others turned gold miners when a minor gold rush brought them to the region. Failing in efforts to strike it rich in gold, these men turned toward harvesting the giant trees [4] for booming development in San Francisco and other places on the West Coast. After many decades of unrestricted clear-cut logging , serious efforts toward conservation began. By the 1920s the work of the Save-the-Redwoods League , founded in 1918 to preserve remaining old-growth redwoods, resulted in the establishment of Prairie Creek , Del Norte Coast , and Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Parks among others. Redwood National Park was created in 1968, by which time nearly 90% of the original redwood trees had been logged. The National Park Service (NPS) and the California Department of Parks and Recreation (CDPR) administratively combined Redwood National Park with the three abutting Redwood State Parks in 1994 for the purpose of cooperative forest management and stabilization of forests and watersheds as a single unit. [5] The ecosystem of the RNSP preserves a number of threatened animal species such as the tidewater goby , Chinook salmon , northern spotted owl , and Steller's sea lion . [6] In recognition of the rare ecosystem and cultural history found in the parks, the United Nations designated them a World Heritage Site on September 5, 1980 and part of the California Coast Ranges International Biosphere Reserve on June 30, 1983.

Archaeological study shows they arrived in the area as far back as 3,000 years ago. An 1852 census determined that the Yurok were the most numerous, with 55 villages and an estimated population of 2,500. [9] They used the abundant redwood, which with its linear grain was easily split into planks, as a building material for boats, houses, and small villages. [10] For buildings, the planks would be erected side by side in a narrow trench, with the upper portions bound with leather strapping and held by notches cut into the supporting roof beams. Redwood boards were used to form a shallow sloping roof. [11] Previous to Jedediah Smith in 1828, no other explorer of European descent is known to have thoroughly investigated the inland region away from the immediate coast. The discovery of gold along the Trinity River in 1850 led to a minor secondary rush in California. This brought miners into the area and many stayed on at the coast after failing to strike it rich. This quickly led to conflicts wherein native peoples were placed under great strain, if not forcibly removed or massacred. [12] By 1895, only one third of the Yurok in one group of villages remained; by 1919, virtually all members of the Chilula tribe had either died or been assimilated into other tribes. [13] The miners logged redwoods for building; when this minor gold rush ended, some of them turned again to logging, cutting down the giant redwood trees. Initially, over 2,000,000 acres (8,100\u00a0km 2 ) of the California and southwestern coast of Oregon were old-growth redwood forest, but by 1910, extensive logging led conservationists and concerned citizens to begin seeking ways to preserve the remaining trees, which they saw being logged at an alarming rate. [14] In 1911, U.S. Representative John E. Raker , of California, became the first politician to introduce legislation for the creation of a redwood national park. However, no further action was taken by Congress at that time. The coast redwood is the tallest tree species on Earth. Preservation of the redwood stands in California is considered one of the most substantial conservation contributions of the Boone and Crockett Club . The Save-the-Redwoods League was founded in 1918 by Boone and Crockett Club members Madison Grant , John C. Merriam , Henry Fairfield Osborn , and future member, Frederick Russell Burnham . The initial purchases of land were made by club member Stephen Mather and William Kent. In 1921, Boone and Crockett Club member John C. Phillips donated $32,000 to purchase land and create the Raynal Bolling Memorial Grove in the Humboldt Redwoods State Park . [15] This was timely as U.S. Route 101 , which would soon provide nearly unfettered access to the trees, was under construction. Using matching funds provided initially by the County of Humboldt and later by the State of California, the Save-the-Redwoods League managed to protect areas of concentrated or multiple redwood groves and a few entire forests in the 1920s. As California created a state park system, beginning in 1927, three of the preserved redwood areas became Prairie Creek Redwoods, Del Norte Coast Redwoods, and Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Parks. A fourth became Humboldt Redwoods State Park , by far the largest of the individual Redwood State Parks, but not in the Redwood National and State Park system. Because of the high demand for lumber during World War II and the construction boom that followed in the 1950s, the creation of a national park was delayed. Efforts by the Save-the-Redwoods League, the Sierra Club , and the National Geographic Society to create a national park began in the early 1960s. [16] After intense lobbying of Congress , the bill creating Redwood National Park was signed by President Lyndon Johnson on October 2, 1968. The Save-the-Redwoods League and other entities purchased over 100,000 acres (400\u00a0km 2 ), which were added to existing state parks. In 1978, 48,000 acres (190\u00a0km 2 ) were added to Redwood National Park in a major expansion. [16] However, only a fifth of that land was old-growth forest, the rest having been logged. This expansion protected the watershed along Redwood Creek from being adversely affected by logging operations outside the park. The federal and state parks were administratively combined in 1994. [17] The United Nations designated Redwood National and State Parks a World Heritage Site on September 5, 1980. The evaluation committee noted 50 prehistoric archaeological sites, spanning 4,500\u00a0years. It also cited ongoing research in the park by Humboldt State University researchers, among others. [18] The park is part of a much larger region designated the California Coast Ranges International Biosphere Reserve on June 30, 1983. [19] The California Coast Ranges biosphere is overseen by the University of California Natural Reserve System . The park has served as a filming location for numerous films. Scenes set on the forest moon Endor in Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi were filmed in the Tall Trees Redwood Grove in the northern part of Humboldt County , though the majority of filming was in private and public forests near the town of Smith River, California . Scenes for The Lost World: Jurassic Park as well as the movie Outbreak were filmed at the nearby Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park and at Patrick's Point State Park . [20] Park management [ edit ] Map illustrates Redwood National and State Parks features and boundaries. Redwood National Park headquarters is located in Crescent City, California , with a service office located in Arcata and an operations center located in Orick, California . Lack of money has precluded major improvements, however, and timber companies have replanted much of the logged area with non-native tree species. Coastline areas, including dunes and coastal prairie, have been invaded by exotic species, partly due to the suppression of forest fires until the 1980s. A fire management plan now allows controlled burning as one method to return the parkland to its original state. Since the redwoods were logged on the basis of accessibility, with inaccessible areas being cut last, large old-growth forest sections were isolated from one another, sometimes by many miles. In these cases it will be decades more before mature forest can return, regardless of the amount of money used to rehabilitate the ecosystem. [21] The park has transformed a few logging roads into scenic public drives. These do not meet current safety standards, but funding to improve them is not available at present. Park structures such as visitor centers and employee housing also need updating to meet increasing demands. Park employees perform air and water quality surveys, monitor endangered and threatened species , and work closely with the California Coastal National Monument , which is managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management . [22] In 2005, the parks were authorized to expand another 25,000 acres (100\u00a0km 2 ) to include the Mill Creek watershed. [23] Natural resources [ edit ] The Redwood National and State Parks form one of the most significant protected areas of the Northern California coastal forests ecoregion. Flora [ edit ] It is estimated that old-growth redwood forest once covered close to 2,000,000 acres (8,100\u00a0km 2 ) of coastal northern California. [24] 96% of all old-growth redwoods have been logged, and almost half (45%) of the redwoods remaining are found in Redwood National and State Parks. The parks protect 38,982 acres (157.75\u00a0km 2 ) of old-growth forest almost equally divided between federal 19,640 acres (79.5\u00a0km 2 ) and state 19,342 acres (78.27\u00a0km 2 ) management. [23] Redwoods have existed along the coast of northern California for at least 20\u00a0million years and are related to tree species that existed 160\u00a0million years ago. [25] The native range of coast redwood is from the northern California coast north to the southern Oregon Coast . The tree is closely related to the giant sequoia of central California, and more distantly to the dawn redwood which is indigenous to the Sichuan \u2013 Hubei region of China. Coast redwoods are the tallest trees on Earth; as of September 2006, the tallest tree in the park was Hyperion at 379.1 feet (115.5\u00a0m), followed by Helios and Icarus which were 376.3 feet (114.7\u00a0m) and 371.2 feet (113.1\u00a0m) respectively. [26] Sequoia sempervirens Before September 2006, the tallest living specimen known was the Stratosphere Giant , outside the park in Humboldt Redwoods State Park , which was 370 feet (110\u00a0m) in 2004. For many years, one specimen simply named Tall Tree in Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park and within the RNSP was measured at 367.8 feet (112.1\u00a0m), but the top 10 feet (3.0\u00a0m) of the tree was reported to have died in the 1990s. [27] One tree that fell in 1991 was reported to be 372.04 feet (113.40\u00a0m). Only the giant sequoia has more mass. The largest redwood by volume is the 42,500\u00a0cubic foot (1,205\u00a0m\u00b3) Lost Monarch , located in Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park. Mature Coast redwoods live an average of 500\u2013700\u00a0years and a few are documented to be 2,000\u00a0years old, making them some of the longest-living organisms on earth. [23] [28] They are highly resistant to disease, due to a thick protective bark and high tannin content. Redwoods prefer sheltered slopes, slightly inland and near water sources such as rivers and streams. Redwood trees develop enormous limbs that accumulate deep organic soils and can support tree-sized trunks growing on them. This typically occurs above 150 feet (46\u00a0m). Scientists have recently discovered that plants which normally grow on the forest floor also grow in these soils, well above ground. The soil mats provide homes to invertebrates , mollusks , earthworms , and salamanders . During drought seasons, some treetops die back, but the trees do not die outright. Instead, redwoods have developed mechanisms to regrow new trunks from other limbs. These secondary trunks, called reiterations , also develop root systems in the accumulated soils at their bases. This helps transport water to the highest reaches of the trees. Coastal fog also provides up to one-third of their annual water needs. [29] Another large tree commonly found in the forest is the coast Douglas-fir , which has been measured at heights of over 300 feet (91\u00a0m). Sitka spruce are plentiful along the coast and are better adapted to salty air than other species. The evergreen hardwood tanoak produces a nut similar to the acorns produced by the related genus Quercus ( oak ). Both tanoaks and oaks are members of the beech family . Trees such as the Pacific madrone , bigleaf maple , California laurel , and red alder are also widespread throughout the parks. [30] Huckleberry , blackberry , and salmonberry are part of the forest understory and provide food for many animal species. The California rhododendron and azalea are flowering shrubs common in the park, especially in old-growth forest. [30] Plants such as the sword fern are prolific, particularly near ample water sources. In Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park, Fern Canyon is a well-known ravine 30 to 50 feet (9.1 to 15.2\u00a0m) deep, with walls completely covered in ferns. Fauna [ edit ] Northern spotted owl ( Strix occidentalis caurina ) is a threatened species known to exist in the parks. The ecosystems of RNSP preserve a number of rare animal species. Numerous ecosystems exist, with seacoast, river, prairie, and densely forested zones all within the park. The tidewater goby is a federally listed endangered species that live near the Pacific coastline. The bald eagle , which usually nests near a water source, is listed as a state of California endangered species. The Chinook salmon , northern spotted owl , and Steller's sea lion are a few of the other animal species that are threatened. [6] [31] Over 40 species of mammals have been documented, including the black bear , coyote , cougar , bobcat , beaver , river otter , black-tailed deer , and elk . Along the coastline, California sea lions , Steller sea lions and harbor seals live near the shore and on seastacks, rocky outcroppings forming small islands just off the coast. Dolphins and Pacific gray whales are occasionally seen offshore. Roosevelt elk are the most readily observed of the large mammals in the park. Successful herds, brought back from the verge of extinction in the region, are now a common site in park areas south of the Klamath River . Many smaller mammals live in the high forest canopy. Different species of bats , such as the big brown bat , and other smaller mammals including the red squirrel and northern flying squirrel spend most of their lives well above the forest floor. [29] Brown pelicans and double-crested cormorants are mainly found on cliffs along the coast and on seastacks, while sandpipers and gulls inhabit the seacoast and inland areas. Inland, freshwater-dependent birds such as the common merganser , osprey , red-shouldered hawk , great blue heron , and Steller's jay are a few of the bird species that have been documented. At least 400 bird species have been documented in the forestlands. [32] Reptiles and amphibians can also be found in the parks, with the northwestern ringneck snake , northern red-legged frog , Pacific giant salamander , and the rough-skinned newt most commonly seen. [31] Invasive species [ edit ] Currently, there are over 200 exotic species known to live in Redwood National and State Parks. Of these thirty have been identified as invasive species , ten of these are considered threats to local species and ecosystems. Exotic species currently account for about a quarter of the total flora in the parks. Only about one percent of plant growth in old-growth areas are of exotic species, while areas such as the Bald Hills prairies have a relative cover of fifty to seventy-five percent exotic. [33] The type of foreign vegetation also varies, with plants such as the English Ivy (Hedera helix), Spotted Knapweed (Centaurea maculosa), and the Poison Hemlock (Conium maculatum). The spotted knapweed and poison hemlock are both under consideration for addition to a high priority watch list maintained by the park system. [34] Geology [ edit ] Coastline area The northern coastal region of California, which includes RNSP and the adjacent offshore area, is the most seismically active in the U.S. [35] Frequent minor earthquakes in the park and offshore under the Pacific Ocean have resulted in shifting river channels, landslides , and erosion of seaside cliffs. The North American , Pacific , and Gorda Plates are tectonic plates that all meet at the Mendocino Triple Junction , only 100 miles (160\u00a0km) southwest of the parks. During the 1990s, more than nine magnitude 6.0 earthquakes occurred along this fault zone resulting in 1 death and major financial loss, and there is always potential for a major earthquake. [36] The park ensures that visitors are aware of the potential for a major earthquake through the use of pamphlets and information posted throughout the parks. The threat of a tsunami is of particular concern, and visitors to the seacoast are told to seek higher ground immediately after any significant earthquake. [35] Both coastline and the Coast Ranges can be found within park boundaries. The majority of the rocks in the parks are part of the Franciscan Assemblage , uplifted from the ocean floor millions of years ago. These sedimentary rocks are primarily sandstone , siltstone , shale , and chert , with lesser amounts of metamorphic rocks such as greenstone . For the most part, these rocks are easily eroded, and can be viewed along the seacoast and where rivers and streams have cut small gorges. Formed during the Cretaceous Period, they are highly deformed from uplift and folding processes. In some areas, river systems have created fluvial deposits of sand, mud, and gravel, which are transported into the park from upstream. Redwood Creek follows the Grogan Fault ; along the west bank of the creek, schist and other metamorphic rocks can be found, while sedimentary rocks of the Franciscan Assemblage are located on the east bank.

The Redwood National and State Parks have an oceanic temperate rainforest climate, with cool-summer Mediterranean characteristics. Weather in RNSP is greatly influenced by the Pacific Ocean. Coastal temperatures generally range between 40 and 60\u00a0degrees Fahrenheit (4\u201315\u00a0\u00b0C) all year round, while further from the coast summers are hotter and drier, and winters are colder. [39] Redwoods mostly grow a mile or two (1.5\u20133\u00a0km) from the coast, and never more than 50 miles (80\u00a0km) from it. In this temperate but humid coastal zone, the trees receive moisture from both heavy winter rains and persistent summer fog. The presence and consistency of the summer fog is actually more important to overall health of the trees than heavy precipitation. This fact is born out in annual precipitation totals, which range between 25 and 122 inches (64 and 310\u00a0cm) annually, with healthy redwood forests throughout the areas of less precipitation because excessive needs for water are mitigated by the ever-present summer fog and the cooler temperatures it ensures. Snow is uncommon even on peaks above 1,500 feet (460\u00a0m), further exemplifying the mild, temperate nature of this northern latitude; [40] however, light snow mixed with rain is common during the winter months. Fire management [ edit ] Wildfires are a natural part of most terrestrial ecosystems. In many ways nature has adapted to fire, and the absence of fire can often be disadvantageous. [41] Wildfire eliminates dead and decayed plant and tree matter, enriching the soil and ensuring that healthier trees have less competition for limited nutrients. Prescribed fire is currently part of the fire management plan and helps to eliminate exotic species of plants and allows a more fertile and natural ecosystem. Fire is also used to protect prairie grasslands and to keep out forest encroachment, ensuring sufficient rangeland for elk and deer. The oak forest regions also benefit from controlled burns, as Douglas fir would otherwise eventually take over and decrease biodiversity . The use of fire in old-growth redwood zones reduces dead and decaying material, and lessens the mortality of larger redwoods by eliminating competing vegetation. In the park, a fire management plan monitors all fires, weather patterns and the fuel load (dead and decaying plant material). This fuel load is removed from areas near structures and where fire poses high risk to the public, and controlled burns are used elsewhere. [42] The National Interagency Fire Center provides additional firefighters and equipment in the event of a large fire. Recreation [ edit ] Scene along a hiking trail in Fern Canyon The DeMartin Redwood Youth Hostel, a low-amenities shared lodging facility (near Klamath ), has now closed. There are no hotels or motels within the parks boundaries. However, nearby towns such as Klamath, Requa, and Orick provide small hotels and inns, with extensive lodging options available in the regional trading centers of Crescent City on the northern end of the park and Arcata and Eureka located to the south. The park is about 260 miles (420\u00a0km) north of San Francisco , and 300 miles (480\u00a0km) south of Portland, Oregon ; U.S. Route 101 passes through it from north to south. The Smith River National Recreation Area , part of the Six Rivers National Forest , is adjacent to the north end of RNSP. While the state parks have front country campsites that can be driven to, the federal sections of the park do not, and hiking is the only way to reach back country campsites. These are at Mill Creek campground in Del Norte Coast Redwoods State Park and Jedediah Smith campground in Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park, which together have 251 campsites; the Elk Prairie campground in Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park which has 75; and the Gold Bluffs Beach campground which has 25 campsites. Other nearby state parks have additional front country camping. [43] Back country camping is by permit only and is only allowed in designated sites, except on gravel bars along Redwood Creek . Access to the back country is highly regulated to prevent overuse while permitting as many groups as possible to explore the forest. Camping in the back country is therefore limited to five consecutive nights, and 15 nights in any one year. Proper food storage to minimize encounters with bears is strongly enforced, and hikers and backpackers are required to take out any trash they generate. [44] Horse riders entering Redwood National Park Almost 200 miles (320\u00a0km) of hiking trails exist in the parks, but during the rainy season some temporary footbridges are removed, as they would be destroyed by high streams. Throughout the year, trails are often wet and hikers need to be well prepared for rainy weather and consult information centers for updates on trail conditions. [44] Horseback riding and mountain biking are popular but are only allowed on certain trails. Kayaking is popular along the seacoast and in the various rivers and streams. Kayakers and canoeists frequently travel the Smith River , which is the longest un dammed river remaining in California. Fishing for salmon and steelhead , a highly prized anadromous form of rainbow trout over 16 inches (41\u00a0cm), is best in the Smith and Klamath rivers . A California sport fishing license is required to fish any of the rivers and streams. [45] Hunting is not permitted anywhere in the parks, but is allowed in nearby National Forests . The park has three visitor centers, where guided nature walks and general information are available, along with two additional information points. [46] Each campground offers campfire talks during the summer months as well as guided tours. [43] The parks have many picnic areas, which are all easily accessed by vehicle.

As per the Constitution of India , the governor is a state's de jure head, but de facto executive authority rests with the chief minister . Following elections to the West Bengal Legislative Assembly , the state's governor usually invites the party (or coalition) with a majority of seats to form the government . The governor appoints the chief minister, whose council of ministers are collectively responsible to the assembly. Given that he has the confidence of the assembly, the chief minister's term is for five years and is subject to no term limits . [1] West Bengal origins lie in Bengal , a province of the British Raj that included present-day Bangladesh . Between 1937 and 1947 it was intermittently governed by a popularly elected ministry , whose head is often designated the Premier of Bengal . In 1947, Bengal province was partitioned into the Indian state of West Bengal and East Pakistan . All three erstwhile Bengal premiers\u2014 A. K. Fazlul Huq , Khawaja Nazimuddin and H. S. Suhrawardy \u2014became Pakistani citizens; the latter two went on to become Prime Ministers of Pakistan in the 1950s. Since 1947, there have been eight Chief Ministers of West Bengal. The first was Prafulla Chandra Ghosh of the Indian National Congress , who was succeeded by his party-mates Dr Bidhan Chandra Roy and Prafulla Chandra Sen . A decade of instability followed, marred by fractious coalition governments and frequent impositions of President's rule . The instability ended with 1977 election victory of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM). Headed by Jyoti Basu , the CPM-led Left Front government was in office for over 23 years (1977\u20132000). Left rule in West Bengal continued for another 10 years under Buddhadeb Bhattacharya , before its defeat in the 2011 election by the Trinamool Congress . Appointed on 20 May 2011, Trinamool leader Mamata Banerjee is the current incumbent , the state's first woman chief minister .

When President's rule is in force in a state, its council of ministers stands dissolved. The office of chief minister thus lies vacant, and the administration is taken over by the governor, who functions on behalf of the central government. At times, the legislative assembly also stands dissolved. [8] References Jump up ^ Durga Das Basu . Introduction to the Constitution of India . 1960. 20th Edition, 2011 Reprint. pp. 241, 245.

It also was not only the last US No. 1 hit by Harrison, but also from any of the ex-Beatles (as of 2018) in the US. When the song hit No. 1, it broke a three-way tie among Harrison, John Lennon , and Ringo Starr , all of whom had two No. 1 hit singles as solo artists (discounting Paul McCartney 's work with Wings ). It also happened to be the No. 1 single in the US the week immediately preceding the induction of The Beatles into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , making Harrison one of the few inductees to have an active single on the US record charts at the time of induction. Billboard ranked it as the No. 3 song for 1988. [1] The single's B-side is \"Lay His Head\", a remixed version of the unreleased song from Harrison's originally intended Somewhere in England album. The 12-inch version of the single also adds an extended version of \"Got My Mind Set on You\". In the UK the single spent four weeks at number two. It was kept off the number 1 spot by T'Pau 's \" China in Your Hand \". The song was included in the Harrison compilation albums Best of Dark Horse 1976\u20131989 (1989) and Let It Roll: Songs by George Harrison (2009). A live version was recorded for his Live in Japan (1992) album. In 2010, AOL radio listeners chose \"Got My Mind Set on You\" as one of the 10 Best George Harrison Songs , appearing at number 4 on the list. [2] Music videos [ edit ] Two music videos were released for the cover version. The first, directed by Gary Weis , starred Alexis Denisof trying for the heart of a girl in an amusement arcade. It featured Harrison and the band inside of a movie viewer, while the young man tries to win a toy ballerina for the girl. [3] The second, which Weis also directed, depicts Harrison sitting and playing in a study . [4] As the song progresses, furniture and knick-knacks (like a stuffed squirrel, sentient chainsaw, a statue and mounted stag and warthog ) begin to dance along with the song. In the middle of the video, Harrison (through the use of a stunt double) performs a backflip from his chair and follows it with a dance routine before jumping back to his seat. The second received significant airplay, and was nominated for three MTV VMAs .

Shakin' Stevens recorded the song for his 2006 album Now Listen.

These methods vary by the sources of information that are drawn on, how that information is sampled, and the types of instruments that are used in data collection. Methods also vary by whether they collect qualitative data, quantitative data or both. Qualitative psychological research is where the research findings are not arrived at by statistical or other quantitative procedures. Quantitative psychological research is where the research findings result from mathematical modeling and statistical estimation or statistical inference. Since qualitative information can be handled as such statistically, the distinction relates to method, rather than the topic studied. There are three main types of psychological research: Correlational research Descriptive research Experimental research The following are common research designs and data collection methods: Archival research Case study Computer simulation (modeling) Content analysis Event sampling methodology , also referred to as experience sampling methodology (ESM), diary study, or ecological momentary assessment (EMA) Experiment , often with separate treatment and control groups (see scientific control and design of experiments ). See Experimental psychology for many details. Field experiment Interview , can be structured or unstructured . Meta-analysis Neuroimaging and other psychophysiological methods Observational study , can be naturalistic (see natural experiment ), participant or controlled. Quasi-experiment Self-report inventory Survey , often with a random sample (see survey sampling ) Twin study Research designs vary according to the period(s) of time over which data are collected: Retrospective cohort study : Subjects are chosen, then data are collected on their past experiences. Prospective cohort study : Subjects are recruited prior to the proposed independent effects being administered or occurring. Cross-sectional study , in which a population are sampled on all proposed measures at one point in time. Longitudinal study : Subjects are studied at multiple time points: May address the cohort effect and indicate causal directions of effects. Research in psychology has been conducted with both animals and human subjects: Animal study Human subject research References [ edit ] Stangor, Charles . (2007).

It was written by Marti Noxon , directed by James Whitmore, Jr. , and first broadcast on April 28, 1998. Contents [ hide ] 1 Plot 2 Production details 3 References 4 External links Plot [ edit ] Buffy stops a male student from shooting a female student. Afterwards, they have no recollection of why they were arguing and the gun disappears. Principal Snyder blames Buffy for the incident. While waiting in his office, a yearbook from 1955 falls off the shelf. In class later that day, Buffy starts daydreaming about a relationship that a student had with his teacher. As she comes back to the present, she finds that her teacher has unknowingly written \"Don't walk away from me, bitch!\" on the black board, a line the male student had shouted. Later, Xander is grabbed by a monster arm from inside his locker. Buffy helps him break away, but the arm then disappears. Giles is intrigued by the possible presence of a poltergeist . Later that night, Giles sees the janitor shoot a teacher, though only moments earlier they were cordial. Giles is convinced that Jenny Calendar is haunting the school. Willow finds information on her laptop about a killing in 1955, where student James Stanley killed his teacher Grace Newman after she tried to break off their affair. In the cafeteria, chaos erupts as the food turns into snakes. Outside, Snyder talks to the police chief about the incident and it is revealed that they know about the Hellmouth under the school and the possibility of Buffy being the Slayer. Drusilla gets a vision about Buffy meeting with death. Willow devises a plan to contain the spirits, and they head off to the school where they prepare, though Giles has already arrived and is trying to summon Jenny's spirit. Buffy hears music coming from the music room and sees Grace and James dancing there. James' face suddenly changes to a gory mess, startling Buffy. On the stairwell, Willow begins to sink into the floor and Giles saves her. Willow finally convinces him that the spirit is not Jenny. A swarm of wasps arrives and surrounds the school. Everyone recuperates at Buffy's while she continues to show her anger towards James. Buffy goes to the kitchen where she finds a sign for the 1955 Sadie Hawkins dance in her pocket as James' voice whispers, \"I need you.\" She heads to the school where the wasps part for her to enter. Willow finds the ad and everyone rushes after Buffy, but they cannot enter the school. Angelus appears in the halls as Buffy, now possessed by James, talks to him as if he were Grace. They repeat the ghosts' argument until, at the climax, Buffy pulls out a gun and shoots Angelus. He falls off of the balcony as though dead. Buffy, still possessed by James, goes to the music room where \"James\" plans to kill himself. Angelus arrives just in time to stop Buffy from pulling the trigger. They exchange apologies and kiss. The spirits leave their bodies. Buffy and Angelus break away from the kiss, and Angelus, disgusted at what he has been doing, pushes Buffy away and flees. Production details [ edit ] Series creator Joss Whedon has said that it was this episode that convinced him that David Boreanaz was an actor strong enough to have his own series. [1] Scriptwriter Marti Noxon said that prior to working on Buffy , she had written several times about ghosts, which for her are figurative expressions of the need for \"repentance and second chances\", drawing on her own family background. \"I realize that I was constantly telling the story of my family and fears,\" she says. Noxon was influenced in her storytelling by the movies Poltergeist and Truly, Madly, Deeply , which featured a widow who was unable to move on after the loss of her husband. [2] The episode borrows its title from The Flamingos' song and features excerpts of it in several scenes.

Although Viago, Vladislav, and Deacon are all several centuries old, they have retained normal human appearances, but the 8,000-year-old Petyr resembles Count Orlok and acts more savagely than the younger vampires. Each night, Viago, Vladislav, and Deacon prowl the streets of Wellington searching for people to kill, but they must stay in the flat during the day to avoid sunlight \u2014 which is lethal to vampires \u2014 and as such have not adapted to 21st-century life. Deacon has a human servant (familiar), Jackie, who runs errands for the vampires, but she is frustrated that Deacon will not turn her into a vampire as he has promised. Jackie leads her ex-boyfriend Nick to the vampire's flat so they can drink his blood; he escapes before they can kill him, but as he leaves the flat, Petyr attacks him and later turns Nick into a vampire. Two months later the vampires accept Nick into their group and also bond with his human friend Stu, a computer programmer who shows them how to use modern technology such as YouTube (to watch sunrises) and cameras (so they can see themselves). Viago in particular is able to find Katherine, his love from many years past, now an old woman in a rest home in Wellington. Despite being able to get his new friends into more popular bars and clubs, Nick struggles to adapt to life as a vampire and carelessly reveals his secret to strangers he meets. One of these strangers, a vampire hunter , breaks into the flat during the day and kills Petyr by exposing him to sunlight. The vampires are furious when they discover Nick has indirectly caused Petyr's death, and banish him from the flat. Some time later, the vampires receive an invitation to a masquerade ball , where they meet other undead and supernatural beings such as zombies and witches , as well as Vladislav's ex-girlfriend Pauline, whom he nicknamed \"The Beast\" due to their hard break-up. Nick, Stu and Jackie also attend. To Deacon's annoyance, Nick has turned Jackie into a vampire. When Pauline realizes that Stu and the camera-crew are human, the other guests try to kill them and Vladislav fights Pauline's new boyfriend. Stu saves Vladislav by impaling Pauline's boyfriend on a stick. The vampires manage to escape the ball with Stu and the film-crew, but encounter a group of werewolves who are about to transform in a forest. Stu and one of the cameramen are caught and attacked by the werewolves. Assuming Stu is dead, the vampires grieve for him. A while later, Stu (having been turned into a werewolf himself) reappears, and eventually reconciles the werewolves with the vampires, who allow them to stay in their flat with them. Nick also resurfaces and is accepted back into the home. Viago reconnects with Katherine, turning her into a vampire and ensuring they can be together forever. Scenes during the credits reveal that Vladislav has gotten back together with Pauline and Jackie has made her husband her new familiar. A post-credits scene shows Deacon attempting to hypnotize the audience to forget the events of the film. Cast [ edit ] Taika Waititi as Viago, aged 379 \u2013 the uptight leader of the household.

(June 2016) The film is based on a 2006 short film of the same name by Waititi and Clement. The new film was shot in Wellington in September 2012, and is Waititi's first feature since Boy . [5] [6] Stu Rutherford, an IT technician in real life, was initially told he would only have a bit part in the film so he would act more natural when filming his parts. He did not realize his role was so important until the film's premiere. Stu had a cameo appearance in the original short film. [9] Waititi revealed that there was so much footage filmed that three cuts were made: one focused primarily on jokes, one focused on story, and the final cut, a mix of the two. [ citation needed ] According to Waititi their favourite vampire films were The Lost Boys , Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula and Interview with the Vampire [10] . All those movies are heavily quoted or referenced in the film, along with many other horror movie classics. Music [ edit ] The score for the film was composed by Plan 9. [11] The film's opening credits feature the song \"You're Dead\" by Norma Tanega , after Clement and Waititi were introduced to the song by film editor Tom Eagles. [12] [13] The film's trailer and ending feature the song \"Lastochka\" by the Russian rock band Leningrad . Release [ edit ] The film was released in a limited release on February 13, 2015 in New York City and Los Angeles , followed by a screening in San Francisco, Irvine, Philadelphia, Boston, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. [14] The film received a regional release in the U.S. in March 2015, by Unison Films, The Orchard , and Paramount Pictures in association with Funny or Die and Paladin Pictures. [15] Critical response [ edit ] What We Do in the Shadows received critical acclaim and has a \"Certified Fresh\" score of 96% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 161 reviews with an average rating of 7.8 out of 10. It is rated #68 on the website's list of Top 100 comedies of all time. The critical consensus states: \"Smarter, fresher, and funnier than a modern vampire movie has any right to be, What We Do in the Shadows is bloody good fun.\" [16] The film also has a score of 76 out of 100 on Metacritic , based on 33 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews. [17] Fearnet called the film \"a great vampire comedy\". [18] Film School Rejects wrote a predominantly positive review, commenting that some of the film's broader moments fell flat but compared it favorably to similar mockumentaries such as Best in Show . [19] The film was warmly received by UK newspapers, with The Guardian ' s film critic Peter Bradshaw describing it as \"the best comedy of the year\", [20] while The Telegraph ' s Tim Robey found it \"desperately funny\". [8] Film International , in a positive review, commended the film for noting, with a double of Count Orlok locked in the vampires' basement, that the true vampire film tradition is repressed by the current craze. [21] Variety was more critical, writing that \"Some genre fans who prefer the silly to the satiric may bite, but the anemic pic isn't remotely weird or witty enough for cult immortality.\" [11] Box office [ edit ] What We Do in the Shadows grossed US $2 million [22] in New Zealand and $3.4 million in the US. [ citation needed ] Home media [ edit ] What We Do in the Shadows was released on DVD and Blu-ray on November 26, 2014 by Weltkino Filmverleih. [ citation needed ] Sequel and spin-off series [ edit ] A sequel to the film, which will focus on the werewolves depicted in What We Do in the Shadows, is currently in development. Originally rumoured to be titled What We Do in the Moonlight, the working title was later announced as We're Wolves . [23] [24] In September 2016, it was revealed that Waititi and Clement are planning a procedural comedy series based on the cops, Karen and Mike, who had minor roles in the film, titled Wellington Paranormal (previously titled Paranormal Event Response Unit ). [25] The series is being funded by NZ On Air by granting Waititi and Clement $1 million to produce six 30-minute episodes for the series, which will air on New Zealand channel TVNZ 2 [26] [27] in mid-2018. [25] An American version of the film is being planned, to be developed as a television series. A pilot has been ordered by FX .

[1] The Constitution was adopted by the Indian Constituent Assembly on 26 November 1949, and came into effect on 26 January 1950 with a democratic government system, completing the country's transition towards becoming an independent republic . 26 January was chosen as the Republic day because it was on this day in 1930 when Declaration of Indian Independence ( Purna Swaraj ) was proclaimed by the Indian National Congress as opposed to the Dominion status offered by British Regime. It is one of three national holidays in India , the other two being Independence Day and Gandhi Jayanti . Contents [ hide ] 1 History of Republic Day 2 Celebrations 2.1 Delhi Republic Day parade 2.2 Beating Retreat 3 Gallery 4 Republic Day parade chief guest 5 Notes 6 See also 7 References History of Republic Day [ edit ] India achieved independence from British raj on 15 August 1947 following the Indian independence movement noted for largely peaceful non-violent resistance and civil disobedience led by Mahatma Gandhi . The independence came through the Indian Independence Act 1947 (10 & 11 Geo 6 c 30), an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that partitioned British India into the two new independent Dominions of the British Commonwealth (later Commonwealth of Nations). [2] India obtained its independence on 15 August 1947 as a constitutional monarchy with George VI as head of state and the Earl Mountbatten as governor-general . The country, though, did not yet have a permanent constitution; instead its laws were based on the modified colonial Government of India Act 1935 . On 28 August 1947, the Drafting Committee was appointed to draft a permanent constitution, with Dr B R Ambedkar as chairman. While India's Independence Day celebrates its freedom from British Rule, the Republic Day celebrates the coming into force of its constitution. A draft constitution was prepared by the committee and submitted to the Assembly on 4 November 1947. [3] The Assembly met, in sessions open to public, for 166 days, spread over a period of two years, 11 months and 18 days before adopting the Constitution. After many deliberations and some modifications, the 308 members of the Assembly signed two hand-written copies of the document (one each in Hindi and English) on 24 January 1950. Two days later, it came into effect throughout the whole nation. Celebrations [ edit ] President Rajendra Prasad (in the horse-drawn carriage) readies to take part in the first Republic Day parade on Rajpath , New Delhi, in 1950. The main Republic Day celebration is held in the national capital, New Delhi , at the Rajpath before the President of India . On this day, ceremonious parades take place at the Rajpath, which are performed as a tribute to India; its unity in diversity and rich cultural heritage. In 2016, on the occasion of the 67th Republic Day, the Protocol Department of the Government of Maharashtra held its first parade on the lines of the Delhi Republic Day parade along the entire stretch of Marine Drive in Mumbai . Delhi Republic Day parade [ edit ] Main article: Delhi Republic Day parade Delhi Republic Day parade is held in the capital, New Delhi. Commencing from the gates of the Rashtrapati Bhavan (the President's residence), Raisina Hill on Rajpath past the India Gate , this event is the main attraction of India's Republic Day Celebrations lasting three days. The parade showcases India's Defence Capability, Cultural and Social Heritage. Nine to twelve different regiments of the Indian Army in addition to the Navy, and Air Force with their bands march past in all their finery and official decorations. The President of India who is the Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Armed Forces , takes the salute. Twelve contingents of various para-military forces of India and other civil forces also take part in this parade. [4] Beating Retreat [ edit ] Main article: Beating Retreat The Beating Retreat ceremony is held after officially denoting the end of Republic Day festivities. It is conducted on the evening of 29 January, the third day after the Republic Day. It is performed by the bands of the three wings of the military, the Indian Army , Indian Navy and Indian Air Force . The venue is Raisina Hill and an adjacent square, Vijay Chowk , flanked by the North and South block of the Rashtrapati Bhavan (President's Palace) towards the end of Rajpath . The Chief Guest of the function is the President of India who arrives escorted by the (PBG), a cavalry unit. When the President arrives, the PBG commander asks the unit to give the National Salute, which is followed by the playing of the Indian National Anthem, Jana Gana Mana , by the Army. The Army develops the ceremony of display by the massed bands in which Military Bands, Pipe and Drum Bands, Buglers and Trumpeters from various Army Regiments besides bands from the Navy and Air Force take part which play popular tunes like Abide With Me , Mahatma Gandhi 's favourite hymn, and Saare Jahan Se Achcha at the end.

Erstwhile Yugoslavia (twice invited) has not been depicted in the map. 5 times (France, UK) 4 times (Bhutan, Russia/USSR) Thrice (Indonesia, Mauritius) Twice (Brazil, Japan, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam) Once Uninvited Since 1950, India has been hosting head of state or government of another country as the state guest of honour for Republic Day celebrations in New Delhi. During 1950\u20131954, Republic Day celebrations were organised at different venues (like Irwin Stadium, Kingsway, Red Fort and Ramlila Grounds). It was only starting 1955 when the parade in its present form was organised at Rajpath. [8] The guest country is chosen after a deliberation of strategic, economic and political interests. During 1950s\u20131970s, a number of NAM and Eastern Bloc countries were hosted by India. In 1968 and 1974, India played host to two countries on the same Republic Day.

It is written in the voice of 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen , who lives in the future, post-apocalyptic nation of Panem in North America. The Capitol , a highly advanced metropolis, exercises political control over the rest of the nation. The Hunger Games is an annual event in which one boy and one girl aged\u00a012\u201318 from each of the twelve districts surrounding the Capitol are selected by lottery to compete in a televised battle to the death. The book received mostly positive responses from major reviewers and authors. It was praised for its plot and character development. In writing The Hunger Games , Collins drew upon Greek mythology , Roman gladiatorial games, and contemporary reality television for thematic content. The novel won many awards, including the California Young Reader Medal , and was named one of Publishers Weekly ' s \"Best Books of the Year\" in 2008. The Hunger Games was first published in hardcover on September 14, 2008, by Scholastic , featuring a cover designed by Tim O'Brien . It has since been released in paperback and also as an audiobook and ebook . After an initial print of 200,000, the book had sold 800,000 copies by February 2010. Since its release, The Hunger Games has been translated into 26 languages, and publishing rights have been sold in 38\u00a0territories. The novel is the first in The Hunger Games trilogy , followed by Catching Fire (2009) and Mockingjay (2010). A film adaptation , directed by Gary Ross and co-written and co-produced by Collins herself, was released in 2012. Contents [ hide ] 1 Background 2 Plot 3 Themes 4 Publication history 5 Critical reception 6 Film adaptation 7 See also 8 References 9 External links Background Collins has said that the inspiration for The Hunger Games came from channel surfing on television. On one channel she observed people competing on a reality show and on another she saw footage of the invasion of Iraq . The two \"began to blur in this very unsettling way\" and the idea for the book was formed. [2] The Greek myth of Theseus served as a major basis for the story, with Collins describing Katniss as a futuristic Theseus, and Roman gladiatorial games provided the framework. The sense of loss that Collins developed through her father's service in the Vietnam War was also an influence on the story, with Katniss having lost her father at age 11, five years before the story begins. [3] Collins stated that the deaths of young characters and other \"dark passages\" were the most difficult parts of the book to write, but that she had accepted that passages such as these were necessary to the story. [4] She considered the moments where Katniss reflects on happier moments in her past to be more enjoyable. [4] Plot See also: The Hunger Games universe The Hunger Games takes place in a nation known as Panem , established in North America after the destruction of the continent's civilization by an unknown apocalyptic event. The nation consists of the wealthy Capitol and twelve surrounding, poorer districts under the Capitol's dictatorial control. The Capitol exploits the districts for their natural resources and cheap labour. [5] District\u00a012 is in the coal -rich region that was once Appalachia , while the Capitol is in the Rocky Mountains . [6] As punishment for a past rebellion against the Capitol, one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 from each district are selected by an annual lottery to participate in the Hunger Games, a contest in which the \"tributes\" must fight to the death in an outdoor arena until only one remains. The event is televised. The story is narrated by 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen , a girl from District\u00a012 who volunteers for the 74th Hunger Games in place of her 12-year-old sister, Primrose . The male tribute is Peeta Mellark , a former schoolmate of Katniss who once gave her bread from his family's bakery when her family was starving. Katniss and Peeta are taken to the Capitol. In the few days before the Games start, they are advised and supported by a team consisting of their drunken mentor, Haymitch Abernathy , the sole living District 12 victor of the Hunger Games; Effie Trinket ; and two fashion stylists and three prep workers who help each tribute look his or her best. Katniss's stylist, Cinna , is the only person at the Capitol she considers a friend. They are also introduced to the general public, given some training, and evaluated by the Gamemakers. Katniss and, to a lesser extent, Peeta set themselves apart from the other tributes. Rue, the petite 12-year-old girl tribute from District 11, takes to following them around. Each tribute is interviewed on television by Caesar Flickerman ; they use the opportunity to try to obtain \"sponsors\", who can send them potentially life-saving gifts during the Games. In his interview, Peeta reveals his longtime unrequited love for Katniss. At first, Katniss believes this is simply a ploy to gain sponsors and make her let her guard down. (Much later, she comes to accept he is sincere.) Haymitch promotes their image as \" star-crossed lovers \". Nearly half the tributes are killed in the first day of the Games, fighting over the weapons and supplies strewn around their starting point. Katniss nearly dies, ignoring Haymitch's advice to flee immediately. She uses her well-practiced hunting and survival skills to hide in the woods. A few days later, an artificial fire drives Katniss toward the others. She is spotted and treed by the \"Careers\" (tributes from the richer, loyal districts who have trained intensively for the Games) ... and Peeta, who seems to have allied with them. Rue is hiding in a nearby tree. Silently, she directs Katniss's attention to a trackerjacker nest. Katniss saws through the branch holding the nest, sending it plummeting down. The venom of the flying insects kills one girl and drives the others away. However, Katniss is stung herself and begins hallucinating. Peeta returns, but instead of killing her, he tells her to run away. She and Rue become allies and friends, but Rue is later fatally wounded by another tribute, whom Katniss kills with an arrow. Katniss sings to Rue until she dies and spreads flowers over the body to show her defiance against the Capitol. In an unprecedented move, Rue's district sends Katniss a gift of bread. Then a rule change is announced, allowing the tributes from the same district to win as a couple. Katniss finds and nurses a seriously wounded Peeta, while continuing to act the part of a girl in love to gain gifts. When the Gamemakers announce that what each contestant needs most will be provided at a feast, Katniss risks her life to obtain medicine for Peeta. She is pinned to the ground by Clove, who gloats about Rue while toying with the helpless Katniss. That talk costs Clove her life, however; Thresh, the male District 11 tribute, kills her, but spares Katniss - once - for Rue's sake. The medicine saves Peeta's life. Finally, Katniss and Peeta are the last two survivors, but the Gamemakers cancel the rule change in an attempt to force them into a dramatic finale, in which one must kill the other. Instead, Katniss defiantly retrieves highly poisonous \"nightlock\" berries and offers half to Peeta. Realizing that Katniss and Peeta intend to commit suicide, the Gamemakers announce that they are the victors of the 74th Hunger Games. Although she receives a hero's welcome, Katniss is warned by Haymitch that she has now become a target after defying the Capitol so publicly. Afterward, Peeta is heartbroken when he learns that her actions in the arena were part of a calculated ploy to gain sympathy from the audience. However, Katniss is unsure of her own feelings. Themes The Hunger Games author Suzanne Collins in 2010 In an interview with Collins, it was noted that the novel \"tackles issues like severe poverty , starvation, oppression, and the effects of war among others.\" [7] The novel deals with the struggle for self-preservation that the people of Panem face in their districts and the Hunger Games in which they must participate. [2] The citizens' starvation and their need for resources, both in and outside of the arena, create an atmosphere of helplessness that the main characters try to overcome in their fight for survival. Katniss needs to hunt to provide food for her family, resulting in the development of skills that are useful to her in the Games (such as her proficiency with the bow and arrow), and represents her rejection of the Capitol's rules in the face of life-threatening situations. [8] On the subject of the Games' parallels with popular culture, Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly writes that the book \"is an incisive satire of reality television shows\", and that the character of Cinna \"almost seems like a contestant on a fascist version of Project Runway , using Katniss' outfits as a vehicle to express potentially dangerous ideas.\" [9] The choices the characters make and the strategies they use are often morally complex. The tributes build a personality they want the audience to see throughout the Games. [8] Library journal Voice of Youth Advocates names the major themes of The Hunger Games as \"government control, ' big brother ', and personal independence.\" [10] The trilogy's theme of power and downfall, similar to that of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar , was pointed out by its publisher Scholastic . [11] Laura Miller of The New Yorker finds the author's stated premise of the Games \u2013an exercise in propaganda and a \"humiliating as well as torturous [...] punishment\" for a failed uprising against the Capitol many years earlier\u2013 to be unconvincing. \"You don't demoralize and dehumanize a subject people by turning them into celebrities and coaching them on how to craft an appealing persona for a mass audience.\" But the story works much better if the theme is vicissitudes of high school and \"the adolescent social experience\". Miller writes: \"The rules are arbitrary, unfathomable, and subject to sudden change. A brutal social hierarchy prevails, with the rich, the good-looking, and the athletic lording their advantages over everyone else. To survive you have to be totally fake. Adults don't seem to understand how high the stakes are; your whole life could be over, and they act like it's just some \"phase\"! Everyone's always watching you, scrutinizing your clothes or your friends and obsessing over whether you're having sex or taking drugs or getting good enough grades, but no one cares who you really are or how you really feel about anything.\" [12] Donald Brake from The Washington Times and pastor Andy Langford state that the story has Christian themes, such as that of self-sacrifice , which is found in Katniss' substitution for her younger sister, analogous to the sacrifice of Jesus as a substitute for the atonement of sins . [13] [14] Brake, as well as another reviewer, Amy Simpson, both find that the story also revolves around the theme of hope , which is exemplified in the \"incorruptible goodness of Katniss' sister, Primrose.\" [15] Simpson also points to events similar to the Passion of Jesus ; in the Games, \"Christ figure\" Peeta Mellark is stabbed after warning Katniss to flee for her life, and is then buried in the ground and placed in a cave for three days before emerging with a new lease on life. [15] Further, she finds that the Christian image of the Bread of Life is used throughout The Hunger Games ; in the story, Peeta gives Katniss a loaf of bread, saving the girl and her family from starvation. [15] Publication history After writing the novel, Collins signed a six-figure deal for three books with Scholastic. First published as a hardcover in the United States on September 14, 2008, The Hunger Games had a first printing of 50,000\u00a0copies, which was bumped up twice to 200,000\u00a0copies. [2] By February 2010, the book had sold 800,000\u00a0copies, [16] and rights to the novel had been sold in 38 territories worldwide. [16] A few months later, in July, the book was released in paperback. [17] The Hunger Games entered the New York Times Best Seller list in November 2008, [18] where it would feature for over 100\u00a0consecutive weeks. [19] By the time the film adaptation of The Hunger Games was released in March 2012, the book had been on USA Today ' s best-sellers list for 135 consecutive weeks and has sold over 17.5 million copies. [20] [21] The novel is the first in The Hunger Games trilogy ; it is followed by sequels Catching Fire (2009) and Mockingjay (2010). In March 2012, during the time of The Hunger Games film's release, Scholastic reported 26 million Hunger Games trilogy books in print, including movie tie-in books. [22] The Hunger Games (and its sequels) have sold exceptionally well in ebook format. Suzanne Collins is the first children's or young adult author to sell over one million Amazon Kindle ebooks, making her the sixth author to join the \"Kindle Million Club\". [23] In March 2012, Amazon announced that Collins had become the best-selling Kindle ebook author of all time. [24] An audiobook version of The Hunger Games was released in December 2008. Read by the actress Carolyn McCormick , it has a total running time of eleven hours and fourteen minutes. [25] The magazine AudioFile said: \"Carolyn McCormick gives a detailed and attentive narration. However, she may rely too much on the strength of the prose without providing the drama young adult listeners often enjoy.\" [26] School Library Journal also praised the audiobook, stating that \"McCormick ably voices the action-packed sequences and Katniss's every fear and strength shines through, along with her doomed growing attraction to one of her fellow Tributes.\" [27] The Tim O'Brien -designed cover features a gold \" mockingjay \" \u2013 a fictional bird in The Hunger Games born by crossbreeding female mockingbirds and genetically engineered male \" jabberjays \" \u2013 with an arrow engraved in a circle. This is a depiction of the pin worn by Katniss into the arena, given to her by the District\u00a012 mayor's daughter, Madge Undersee . [28] The image matches the description of the pin that is given in the novel, except for the arrow: \"It's as if someone fashioned a small golden bird and then attached a ring around it. The bird is connected to the ring only by its wing tips.\" [29] Critical reception The Hunger Games has received critical acclaim. In a review for The New York Times , John Green wrote that the novel was \"brilliantly plotted and perfectly paced\", and that \"the considerable strength of the novel comes in Collins's convincingly detailed world-building and her memorably complex and fascinating heroine.\" However, he also noted that, while allegorically rich, the book sometimes does not realize the allegorical potential that the plot has to offer and that the writing \"described the action and little else.\" [30] Time magazine's review was also positive, stating that it \"is a chilling, bloody and thoroughly horrifying book\" and praising what it called the \"hypnotic\" quality of the violence. [31] In Stephen King 's review for Entertainment Weekly , he compared it to \"shoot-it-if-it-moves videogames in the lobby of the local eightplex; you know it's not real, but you keep plugging in quarters anyway.\" However, he stated that there were \"displays of authorial laziness that kids will accept more readily than adults\" and that the love triangle was standard for the genre. He gave the book a B grade. [32] Elizabeth Bird of School Library Journal praised the novel, saying it is \"exciting, poignant, thoughtful, and breathtaking by turns\", and called it one of the best books of 2008. [33] Booklist also gave a positive review, praising the character violence and romance involved in the book. [34] Kirkus Reviews gave a positive review, praising the action and world-building, but pointed out that \"poor copyediting in the first printing will distract careful readers\u2013a crying shame\". [35] Rick Riordan , author of the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series, claims it is the \"closest thing to a perfect adventure novel\" he has ever read. [36] Stephenie Meyer (author of the Twilight series ) endorsed the book on her website, saying, \"I was so obsessed with this book\u00a0... The Hunger Games is amazing.\" [37] The Hunger Games received many awards and honors. It was named one of Publishers Weekly 's \"Best Books of the Year\" in 2008 [38] and a The New York Times \"Notable Children's Book of 2008\". [39] It was the 2009 winner of the Golden Duck Award in the Young Adult Fiction Category. [40] The Hunger Games was also a \"2008 Cybil Winner\" for fantasy and science-fiction books along with The Graveyard Book , [41] one of School Library Journal ' s \"Best Books 2008\", [42] and a \"Booklist Editors' Choice\" in 2008. [43] In 2011, the book won the California Young Reader Medal . [44] In the 2012\u00a0edition of Scholastic's Parent and Child magazine, The Hunger Games was listed as the 33rd-best book for children, with the award for \"Most Exciting Ending\". [45] [46] The novel is one of the top 5 best selling Kindle books of all time. [47] However, the novel has also been controversial with parents; [48] it ranked in fifth place on the American Library Association 's list of frequently challenged books for 2010, with \"unsuited to age group\" and \"violence\" being among the reasons cited. [49] Similarities of The Hunger Games to Koushun Takami 's 1999\u00a0novel Battle Royale have been noted. [50] Collins stated that she \"had never heard of that book or that author until my book was turned in. At that point, it was mentioned to me, and I asked my editor if I should read it. He said: 'No, I don't want that world in your head. Just continue with what you're doing'.\" [50] Susan Dominus of The New York Times reports that \"the parallels are striking enough that Collins's work has been savaged on the blogosphere as a baldfaced ripoff\" of Battle Royale but argued that \"there are enough possible sources for the plot line that the two authors might well have hit on the same basic setup independently.\" [51] Stephen King noted that the reality TV \"badlands\" were similar to Battle Royale , as well as his own novels The Running Man and The Long Walk . [32] Film adaptation Main article: The Hunger Games (film) In March 2009, Lions Gate Entertainment entered into a co-production agreement for The Hunger Games with Nina Jacobson 's production company Color Force, which had acquired worldwide distribution rights to the novel a few weeks earlier. [52] [53] The studio, which had not made a profit for five years, raided the budgets of other productions and sold assets to secure a budget of $88,000,000 \u2013 one of its largest ever [54] \u2013 for the film. [55] [56] Collins' agent Jason Dravis remarked that \"they [Lionsgate] had everyone but the valet call us\" to help secure the franchise. [56] Intending the film to have a PG-13 rating, [57] Collins adapted the novel for film herself, [52] in collaboration with screenwriter Billy Ray and director Gary Ross. [58] [59] The screenplay remains extremely faithful to the original novel, [60] with Ross saying he \"felt the only way to make the film really successful was to be totally subjective\" in its presentation of events, echoing Collins' use of first person present in the novel. [61] Twenty-year-old actress Jennifer Lawrence was chosen to play Katniss Everdeen. [62] Though Lawrence was four years older than the character when filming began, [63] Collins felt the role demanded \"a certain maturity and power\" and said she would rather the actress be older than younger. [64] She added that Lawrence was the \"only one who truly captured the character I wrote in the book\" and that she had \"every essential quality necessary to play Katniss.\" [65] Lawrence, a fan of the books, took three days to accept the role, initially intimidated by the size of the production. [66] [67] Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth were later added to the cast, in the roles of Peeta and Gale, respectively. [68] [69] Production began in late spring 2011 [70] and the film was released on March 23, 2012. [71] The film's opening weekend brought in a non-sequel record $152.5\u00a0million (USD) in North America. [72] The Hunger Games: Catching Fire , based on the second novel in the series, was released the following year on November 22, 2013.

{"question": "the ocen at the end of the lane", "answer": "", "context": "The Ocean at the End of the Lane - Wikipedia The Ocean at the End of the Lane From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search The Ocean at the End of the Lane First edition hardcover for the United States Author Neil Gaiman Country United States Language English Subject Good and evil, survival, magic Genre Dark fantasy , surrealism , horror Publisher William Morrow and Company Publication date 18 June 2013 Media\u00a0type Print, e-book, audiobook Pages 178 pages Award Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel (2014) ISBN 9780062255655 The Ocean at the End of the Lane is a 2013 novel by British author Neil Gaiman . The work was first published on 18 June 2013 through William Morrow and Company and follows an unnamed man who returns to his hometown for a funeral and remembers events that began forty years earlier. [1] Themes in The Ocean at the End of the Lane include the search for self-identity and the \"disconnect between childhood and adulthood\". [2] Among other honours, it was voted Book of the Year in the British National Book Awards . Contents [ hide ] 1 Synopsis 2 Development 3 Reception 4 Awards and honours 5 Film adaptation 6 References 7 External links Synopsis [ edit ] The book starts with the unnamed protagonist returning to his childhood hometown for a funeral. There he revisits the home in which he and his sister grew up and remembers a young girl named Lettie Hempstock, who had claimed that the pond behind her house was an ocean. He stops at the house where Lettie had lived with her mother and grandmother and encounters a member of her family and starts to remember forgotten incidents from the past. The main narrative starts as he recalls a time when an opal miner, who was a boarder at the boy's home, steals the narrator's father's car and commits suicide in the back seat, having gambled away his friends' money; this death allows a supernatural being to gain access to our world, leaving money for people in unpleasant ways. After a coin becomes lodged in the narrator's throat overnight, choking him, he seeks his neighbour Lettie's help. She agrees to help, insisting that he accompany her on the travel necessary to find the spirit and bind it. Having been instructed never to let go of her hand, in a moment of surprise he does, and in that instant something lodges in his foot. Once home, he pulls what appears to be a worm out of his foot, but a piece is left inside him. The next day, his mother tells him she is starting a new job and a woman named Ursula Monkton is to look after him and his sister. The narrator takes an instant dislike to her and soon realises that she is actually the worm he had pulled out of his foot. She had used him as a way to travel out of the place he and Lettie had visited and is now inhabiting his house. Ursula quickly ingratiates herself with his family, winning over his sister and seducing his father, while the narrator is alienated from his family and is almost drowned in the bath by his father as Ursula watches. Most of the narrator's time is then spent locked up in his bedroom, avoiding Ursula. Frightened, he manages to escape one night. He barely makes it to the Hempstock farm, where the Hempstocks take care of him and remove the wormhole from his foot, which had been left behind by Ursula as an escape path. Lettie and the narrator confront Ursula, who refuses offers from the Hempstocks to leave peacefully for a world that is less dangerous for her. Unwilling to believe that there could be anything in the world that could harm her, Ursula is attacked and eliminated by \"hunger birds,\" entities that serve a purpose similar to scavengers. These insist on eating the narrator's heart, as a piece of Ursula's wormhole still remains there. The Hempstocks bring him back to the safety of their property through the ocean by their house, which Lettie carries to him in a bucket. While in the ocean, the narrator understands the nature of all things, but the memory fades once he gets out. The Hempstocks promise to keep him safe, but the hunger birds begin to eat his world in order to force him off the property. This proves effective and the narrator attempts to sacrifice himself, only for Lettie to jump in between him and the hunger birds. Lettie's grandmother threatens the hunger birds, which she refers to as \"varmints\", with annihilation if they do not leave. They comply, but Lettie is near death as a result of their attack. The Hempstocks place Lettie's body in the ocean behind their house, where they say that she will rest until ready to return to this world. After these events, the narrator's memory of the incident fades. He has no recollection of Lettie's near-death, instead believing that she had gone to Australia. The book then returns to the present, where the narrator finishes his remembering and is shocked when the Hempstocks inform him that this is not his first time returning to the house \u2013 he had visited the house at least twice during his adult years and it is implied that he visited the farm at least once more before that to return a kitten that he had found during his initial travels with Lettie. It is suggested that the hunger birds did eat his heart after all, but Lettie's sacrifice revived him, and his heart has been slowly growing back ever since. His visits to the farm are the result of Lettie wanting to check up on him while she sleeps and heals. The narrator's concern over the unremembered visits soon fades as he begins to forget the past events once again, telling the Hempstock women to tell Lettie he said \"hello\" if she contacts them from Australia. Development [ edit ] Gaiman has said that members of the Hempstock family have shown up in several of his other works, such as Stardust and The Graveyard Book . [3] He began writing Ocean for his wife Amanda Palmer and did not initially intend for it to become a novel, instead intending to write a novella; [3] while writing, he inserted things that he knew Palmer would enjoy, as she \"doesn't really like fantasy\". [4] Some events in the book were drawn from Gaiman's childhood, such as the theft of a car belonging to the protagonist's father, mirroring a similar event where his father's car was stolen and the thief committed suicide in the vehicle. [4] Reception [ edit ] Critical reception for the book has been generally positive. [5] The New York Times gave a positive review for The Ocean at the End of the Lane , commenting that the book would appeal to multiple age groups. [6] USA Today stated that the novel was thematically similar to his 2002 children's novel Coraline and the 2005 film MirrorMask in that the enemy is \"closer than they might think\", which \"makes his monsters that much more sinister when a woman like Ursula is just downstairs\". [7] An aggregate review site lists it as 81% positive reviews. [8] Awards and honours [ edit ] 2013 The New York Times Best Seller list , #1 Hardcover Fiction.

{"question": "sherlock holmes hound of the baskervilles movie 2002", "answer": "", "context": "The Hound of the Baskervilles (2002 film) - Wikipedia The Hound of the Baskervilles (2002 film) From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search The Hound of the Baskervilles Directed by David Attwood Written by A. Conan Doyle (novel) Allan Cubitt Starring Richard Roxburgh Ian Hart Richard E. Grant Release date 2002 Running time 100 min. Country United Kingdom Language English The Hound of the Baskervilles is a 2002 television adaptation of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 's novel of the same name . Contents [ hide ] 1 Plot 2 Cast 3 Production 3.1 Writing 3.2 Development 4 Critical reaction 5 References 6 External links Plot [ edit ] Sherlock Holmes and his companion Dr. Watson investigate the case of an attempted murder inspired by the legend of a fearsome, diabolical hound of supernatural origin on Dartmoor in Devon in England's West Country . Cast [ edit ] Richard Roxburgh as Sherlock Holmes Ian Hart as Doctor Watson Richard E. Grant as Jack Stapleton Matt Day as Sir Henry Baskerville John Nettles as Dr. James Mortimer Geraldine James as Mrs. Mortimer Neve McIntosh as Beryl Stapleton Ron Cook as Mr. Barrymore Liza Tarbuck as Mrs. Barrymore Production [ edit ] Writing [ edit ] Some differences from the novel: Sherlock Holmes is shown to be using drugs despite having a challenging case, contrary to the literary depiction in which he uses cocaine recreationally only in the absence of mental exercise. Stapleton is depicted to be the anthropologist instead of Mortimer. Stapleton's (or Mortimer's) interest in entomology is omitted. The character of Dr. Mortimer's wife is shown, depicted as a medium. This version portrays a s\u00e9ance performed by Dr. Mortimer's wife. [1] This scene never appeared in the original novel, though a similar scene did appear in the 1939 Basil Rathbone version of the film . [1] In this film, the escaped convict Selden is seen escaping from the police, and later he attacks Sir Henry in Baskerville Hall. In the novel, Selden is largely only spoken of until his death. Stapleton murders his wife Beryl in this film. In the novel, Beryl survives. Sir Henry is seriously mauled by the hound in the film \u2014 although he is saved in time to receive treatment \u2014 whereas in the novel, Holmes and Watson arrive in time to prevent any true harm to Sir Henry. In the novel, Stapleton apparently dies in the Grimpen Mire. In the movie, Stapleton is shot dead by Watson right before Stapleton was to shoot Holmes, though he still falls into the mire as Holmes was 'drowning' in it before being saved by Watson. Mr Frankland and his daughter Laura Lyons are completely omitted. In the novel, Holmes speculates on various methods that Stapleton could have used to acquire the inheritance of Baskerville Hall \u2014 his main motive for the whole scheme \u2014 without anyone suspecting him for Sir Henry's death due to the anomaly of him living so close to the estate under an assumed name (Options included inheriting the estate after moving back to South America, adopting a disguise to deal with the necessary paperwork, or setting someone else up as the 'official' heir while receiving a sizeable income of his own). In the movie, Stapleton's motives are clearly established as being based on nothing more than a personal vengeance against the family that disinherited his father, Holmes realising during his confrontation that Stapleton has no interest in the inheritance. Stapleton's real name in the film is John Baskerville. In the novel he was named Rodger after his father. In the novel, Stapleton's wife/sister Beryl was a native to Costa Rica. In the film, she appears to be a native of Britain instead. Any reference to South America has been omitted, as is Stapleton's funding a Yorkshire school under the name Vandeleur. Rodger Baskerville, instead of fleeing creditors as he did in the novel, was drummed out of the Guards for conduct unbecoming, and when penniless, married a prostitute named Mary Prescott. The film misses a scene where a pony falls in the swamp when Dr. Watson converses with Stapleton while walking to his place. Instead they convey the fact in the beginning, when Selden is chased by two policemen who drown in it. Cartwright, Holmes's messenger, is not mentioned in the film. In the film, the cabman refuses to tell about his passenger and Holmes had to force him to do so. Also the incident is shown in the film after Watson leaves to go to Baskerville Hall but in the novel is actually before. The legend of the hound and Hugo Baskerville is heavily changed. In the novel, Hugo was infatuated with a farmer's daughter whom he kidnapped and imprisoned. She escaped and Hugo pursued her. Both were found dead. She had died from fright, but a giant spectral hound stood guard over Baskerville's body. The hound tore out Baskerville's throat, then vanished into the night. In the film, Hugo instead has a wife whom he beats out of a jealous belief that she was having an affair with a neighbour. He pursues her across the moor and kills her, but her own hound follows and kills Hugo even as he fatally stabs the creature, and the hound's ghost has since haunted the family. Development [ edit ] Produced by Tiger Aspect Productions for the BBC , it was shown on BBC One on Boxing Day , 2002. It was directed by David Attwood , [2] and adapted by Allan Cubitt . [3] The film stars Richard Roxburgh as Sherlock Holmes and Ian Hart as Doctor Watson . [2] Hart would play Watson again in the 2004 TV film Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Silk Stocking , also written by Cubitt. [4] [1] The hound was a mix of animatronics and computer generated images [1] [5] and was created by the same team, Crawley Creatures and Framestore, that provided the dinosaurs for Walking with Dinosaurs and The Lost World . [1] [3] Critical reaction [ edit ] Richard Scheib of The Science-Fiction, Horror and Fantasy Film Review called the film \"one of the best Sherlock Holmes screen adaptations to date, and arguably the best of all screen versions of The Hound of the Baskervilles that we have.\" [6] Pamela Troy of CultureVulture.net wrote, \"There's a lot that may outrage fans of the original novel, but this is, nonetheless, a respectful, interesting, and worthwhile adaptation.\" [7] Charles Prepolec of the Sherlock Holmes fansite BakerStreetDozen.com wrote, \"In the end, it is a compelling, if somewhat infuriating, film to watch. Not a great Holmes film, and certainly not the greatest version of this story, but it is fascinating television drama.\" [3] References [ edit ] ^ Jump up to: a b c d e The Hound of the Baskervilles at BBC ^ Jump up to: a b A major new version of The Hound Of The Baskervilles for BBC ONE ^ Jump up to: a b c Sherlock Holmes: The Hound of the Baskervilles (2002) \u2013 BakerStreetDozen.com Jump up ^ BBC shows get away with murder in the U.S. Jump up ^ The Hound of the Baskervilles at PBS Jump up ^ The Hound of the Baskervilles (2002).

The opposite of non-volatile memory is volatile memory which needs constant power in order to prevent data from being erased. Examples of non-volatile memory include read-only memory , flash memory , ferroelectric RAM , most types of magnetic computer storage devices (e.g. hard disk drives , solid state drives , floppy disks , and magnetic tape ), optical discs , and early computer storage methods such as paper tape and punched cards . [1] This article is about three distinct storage types: NVS: traditional Non-Volatile Storage in mechanical disks \u2013 Hard disk, Solid State Drive, Optical disk, floppy disk, etc. Non-Volatile Storage may also refer to NVM. NVM: storage in Non-Volatile Memory chips ( Flash memory Storage ) \u2013 EEPROM , SSD , NAND, etc. Non-Volatile Memory may also refer to NVMM. NVMM: [2] storage inside Non-Volatile Main Memory chips ( Re-RAM ) \u2013 NVDIMM-P , specifications to be released 2018. [3] [4] [5] Contents [ hide ] 1 Overview 2 Electrically addressed 2.1 Read-mostly devices 2.2 Flash memory 2.3 Ferroelectric RAM (F-RAM) 2.4 Magnetoresistive RAM (MRAM) 3 Mechanically addressed systems 4 Organic 5 Specifications 6 References 7 External links Overview [ edit ] Non-volatile memory is typically used for the task of secondary storage , or long-term persistent storage. [6] The most widely used form of primary storage today is a volatile form of random access memory (RAM), meaning that when the computer is shut down, anything contained in RAM is lost. However, most forms of non-volatile memory have limitations that make them unsuitable for use as primary storage. Typically, non-volatile memory costs more, provides lower performance, or has worse write endurance than volatile random access memory. Non-volatile data storage can be categorized into electrically addressed systems ( read-only memory ) and mechanically addressed systems ( hard disks , optical disc , magnetic tape , holographic memory , and such). [7] [8] Electrically addressed systems are expensive, but fast, whereas mechanically addressed systems have a low price per bit, but are slow. Several companies are working on developing non-volatile memory systems comparable in speed and capacity to volatile RAM. If successful this would eliminate the need for comparatively slow forms of secondary storage systems such as hard disks. Electrically addressed [ edit ] Main article: Non-volatile random-access memory Electrically addressed semiconductor non-volatile memories can be categorized according to their write mechanism. Mask ROMs are factory programmable only, and typically used for large-volume products not required to be updated after manufacture. Programmable read-only memory can be altered after manufacture, but require a special programmer and usually cannot be programmed while in the target system. The programming is permanent and further changes require replacement of the device. Data is stored by physically altering (burning) storage sites in the device. Read-mostly devices [ edit ] An EPROM is an erasable ROM that can be changed more than once. However, writing new data to an EPROM requires a special programmer circuit. EPROMs have a quartz window that allows them to be erased with ultraviolet light, but the whole device is cleared at one time. A one-time programmable (OTP) device uses an EPROM chip but omits the quartz window in the package; this is less costly to manufacture. An electrically erasable programmable read-only memory EEPROM uses electrical signals to erase memory. These erasable memory devices require a significant amount of time to erase data and to write new data; they are not usually configured to be programmed by the processor of the target system. Data is stored by use of floating-gate transistors which require special operating voltages to be applied to trap or release electric charge on an insulated control gate for storage sites. Flash memory [ edit ] Main article: Flash memory The flash memory chip is a close relative to the EEPROM; it differs in that it can only erase one block or \"page\" at a time. It is a solid-state chip that maintains stored data without any external power source. [9] Capacity is substantially larger than that of an EEPROM, making these chips a popular choice for digital cameras and desktop PC BIOS chips. Flash memory devices use two different logical technologies\u2014NOR and NAND\u2014to map data. NOR flash provides high-speed random access, reading and writing data in specific memory locations; it can retrieve as little as a single byte. NAND flash reads and writes sequentially at high speed, handling data in small blocks called pages, however it is slower on read when compared to NOR. NAND flash reads faster than it writes, quickly transferring whole pages of data. Less expensive than NOR flash at high densities, NAND technology offers higher capacity for the same-size silicon. [9] Ferroelectric RAM (F-RAM) [ edit ] Main article: Ferroelectric RAM Ferroelectric RAM ( FeRAM , F-RAM or FRAM ) is a random-access memory similar in construction to DRAM but (instead of a dielectric layer like in DRAM) contains a thin ferroelectric film of lead zirconate titanate [Pb(Zr,Ti)O 3 ], commonly referred to as PZT. The Zr/Ti atoms in the PZT change polarity in an electric field, thereby producing a binary switch. Unlike RAM devices, F-RAM retains its data memory when power is shut off or interrupted, due to the PZT crystal maintaining polarity. Due to this crystal structure and how it is influenced, F-RAM offers distinct properties from other nonvolatile memory options, including extremely high, although not infinite, endurance (exceeding 10 16 read/write cycles for 3.3\u00a0V devices), ultra low power consumption (since F-RAM does not require a charge pump like other non-volatile memories), single-cycle write speeds, and gamma radiation tolerance. [10] Magnetoresistive RAM (MRAM) [ edit ] Main article: Magnetoresistive random-access memory Magnetoresistive RAM is one of the newest approaches to non-volatile memory and stores data in magnetic storage elements called magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). MRAM has an especially promising future as it seeks to encompass all the desirable features of the other popular types of memory (non-volatility, infinite endurance, high-speed reading/writing, low cost). [11] The first generation of MRAM, such as Everspin Technologies ' 4\u00a0Mbit, utilized field-induced writing. The second generation is developed mainly through two approaches: Thermal-assisted switching (TAS) [11] which is being developed by Crocus Technology , and Spin-transfer torque (STT) which Crocus , Hynix , IBM , and several other companies are developing. [ when? ] [12] Mechanically addressed systems [ edit ] See also: IBM Millipede and holographic memory Mechanically addressed systems utilize a contact structure (\"head\") to read and write on a designated storage medium. Since circuitry layout is not a key factor for data density, the amount of storage is typically much larger than for electrically addressed systems. [ citation needed ] Since the access time depends on the physical location of the data on the device, mechanically addressed systems may not be \"random access\" as are electrically addressed semiconductor NVRAM. For example, magnetic tape stores data as a sequence of bits on a long tape; transporting the tape past the read/write head is required to access any part of the storage. Tape media can be removed from the drive and stored, giving indefinite capacity at the cost of the time required to retrieve a dismounted tape. [13] [14] Hard disk drives use a rotating magnetic disk to store data; access time is longer than for semiconductor memory, but cost per stored data bit is very low, and they provide random access to any location on the disk. Formerly, removable disk packs were common, allowing storage capacity to be expanded. Optical discs store data by altering a pigment layer on a plastic disk, and are similarly random access. Read-only and read-write versions are available; removable media again allows indefinite expansion, and some automated systems were used to retrieve and mount disks under direct program control. [15] [16] [17] Organic [ edit ] Main articles: Organic electronics and ferroelectric memory There are polymer printed ferroelectric memory . Thin Film Electronics (\"Thinfilm\") produces rewriteable non-volatile organic memory based on ferroelectric polymers . Thinfilm successfully demonstrated roll-to-roll printed memories in 2009. [18] [19] [20] In Thinfilm's organic memory the ferroelectric polymer is sandwiched between two sets of electrodes in a passive matrix. Each crossing of metal lines is a ferroelectric capacitor and defines a memory cell. This gives a non-volatile memory comparable to ferroelectric RAM technologies and offer the same functionality as flash memory .

It is the first album by Jarrett's 'European Quartet' featuring Jan Garbarek , Palle Danielsson and Jon Christensen . \"Long As You Know You're Living Yours\" was the subject of a lawsuit between Jarrett and jazz-rock group Steely Dan : Jarrett alleged that the duo's title track from their 1980 album Gaucho had stolen from the song. Co-writer Donald Fagen later admitted he'd loved the song and was strongly influenced by it. [1] Jarrett sued for copyright infringement and was then added as a co-author of the song. \"Long As You Know You're Living Yours\" serves as the theme song for CBC Radio 's Writers and Company program.

{"question": "mandatory elements in the definition of an adverse event (ae)", "answer": "", "context": "Adverse event - Wikipedia Adverse event From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search For the House episode, see Adverse Events . This article needs additional citations for verification . Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (May 2013) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) An adverse event ( AE ) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event (AE) can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. [1] AEs in patients participating in clinical trials must be reported to the study sponsor and if required could be reported to local ethics committee . Adverse events categorized as \"serious\" ( results in death, illness requiring hospitalization, events deemed life-threatening, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, a congenital anomaly/birth defect or medically important condition) must be reported to the regulatory authorities immediately, whereas non-serious adverse events are merely documented in the annual summary sent to the regulatory authority. The sponsor collects AE reports from the local researchers, and notifies all participating sites of the AEs at the other sites, as well as both the local investigators' and the sponsors' judgment of the seriousness of the AEs. This process allows the sponsor and all the local investigators access to a set of data that might suggest potential problems with the study treatment while the study is still ongoing. Contents [ hide ] 1 Types of adverse events 2 Reporting of adverse events 3 Grades of AE 4 Database of adverse events 5 See also 6 References 7 External links Types of adverse events [ edit ] All clinical trials have the potential to produce AEs. AEs are classified as serious or non-serious; expected or unexpected; and study-related, possibly study-related, or not study-related. For example, while a study that tests the effectiveness of a new blood pressure cuff for a period of 10 minutes might seem innocuous, the potential exists for the patient's skin to be irritated by the device. Patients in that study might also die during that 10-minute period. Both skin irritation and sudden death would be considered AEs. In this case, the skin irritation would be classified as not serious, unexpected, and possibly study-related. The death would be classified as serious and unexpected (unless the patient was already at death's door). The local researcher would use his/her medical judgment to determine whether the death could have been related to the study device. Both the skin irritation and the death are unexpected events, and should alert the researcher to the potential existence of a problem with the device (for instance, it could have malfunctioned and shocked the patient). The researcher would report these AEs to the local Institutional Review Board and to the sponsor, and await direction on whether to stop the study. If the researcher feels there is an imminent danger posed by the device, he or she can use medical discretion to stop patients from participating in the study. An adverse event can also be declared in the normal treatment of a patient which is suspected of being caused by the medication being taken or a medical device used in the treatment of the patient. In Australia, 'Adverse EVENT' refers generically to medical errors of all kinds, surgical, medical or nursing related. The most recent available official study (1995) indicated 18,000 deaths per year are a result of hospital care. The Medical Error Action Group is lobbying for legislation to improve the reporting of AEs and through quality control, minimize the needless deaths. Reporting of adverse events [ edit ] Main article: Monitoring in clinical trials Researchers participating in a clinical trial must report all adverse events to the drug regulatory authority of the respective country where the drug or device is to be registered [e.g. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) if it is US]. Serious AEs must be reported immediately; minor AEs are 'bundled' by the sponsor and submitted later. Grades of AE [ edit ] Clinical trial results often report the number of grade 3 and grade 4 adverse events. Grades are defined: [2] Grade 1 Mild AE Grade 2 Moderate AE Grade 3 Severe AE Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling AE Grade 5 Death related to AE Database of adverse events [ edit ] The FDA provides a database for reporting of adverse events called the Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database (MAUDE)[1]. The data consist of voluntary reports since June 1993, user facility reports since 1991, distributor reports since 1993, and manufacturer reports since August 1996, and is open for public view. Two private companies have also recently started providing access to analyzed adverse event information: Clarimed provides adverse event information for medical devices and AdverseEvents provides adverse event data for drugs.

The measure of the public debt is the value of the outstanding Treasury securities at a point of time that have been issued by the Treasury and other federal government agencies. The terms national deficit and national surplus usually refer to the federal government budget balance from year to year, not the cumulative total. A deficit year increases the debt because more money is spent than is received; a surplus year decreases the debt because more money is received than spent. There are two components of gross national debt: [1] Debt held by the public , such as Treasury securities held by investors outside the federal government, including those held by individuals, corporations, the Federal Reserve System and foreign, state and local governments. Debt held by government accounts or intragovernmental debt , such as non-marketable Treasury securities held in accounts administered by the federal government that are owed to program beneficiaries, such as the Social Security Trust Fund . Debt held by government accounts represents the cumulative surpluses, including interest earnings, of various government programs that have been invested in Treasury securities. In general, government debt increases as a result of government spending, and decreases from tax or other receipts, both of which fluctuate during the course of a fiscal year. In practice, Treasury securities are not issued or redeemed on a day-by-day basis, [2] and may also be issued or redeemed as part of the federal government's macroeconomic monetary management operations. The aggregate, gross amount that Treasury can borrow is limited by the United States debt ceiling . [3] Historically, the US public debt as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) has increased during wars and recessions, and subsequently declined. The ratio of debt to GDP may decrease as a result of a government surplus or due to growth of GDP and inflation. For example, debt held by the public as a share of GDP peaked just after World War II (113% of GDP in 1945), but then fell over the following 35 years. In recent decades, however, aging demographics and rising healthcare costs have led to concern about the long-term sustainability of the federal government's fiscal policies . [4] On November 7, 2016, debt held by the public was $14.3 trillion or about 76% of the previous 12 months of GDP. [5] [6] [7] [8] Intragovernmental holdings stood at $5.4 trillion, giving a combined total gross national debt of $19.8 trillion or about 106% of the previous 12 months of GDP; [7] $6.2 trillion or approximately 45% of the debt held by the public was owned by foreign investors, the largest of which were Japan and China at about $1.09 trillion for Japan and $1.06 trillion for China as of December 2016.

The United States government has continuously had a fluctuating public debt since its formation in 1789, except for about a year during 1835\u20131836. To allow comparisons over the years, public debt is often expressed as a ratio to gross domestic product (GDP). The United States public debt as a percentage of GDP reached its highest level during Harry Truman 's first presidential term, during and after World War II . Public debt as a percentage of GDP fell rapidly in the post-World War II period , and reached a low in 1974 under Richard Nixon . Debt as a share of GDP has consistently increased since then, except during the presidencies of Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton . Public debt rose during the 1980s, as Ronald Reagan cut tax rates and increased military spending. It fell during the 1990s, due to decreased military spending, increased taxes and the 1990s boom . Public debt rose sharply in the wake of the 2007\u20132008 financial crisis and the resulting significant tax revenue declines and spending increases. [10] Valuation and measurement [ edit ] Public and government accounts [ edit ] Detailed breakdown of government holders of treasury debt and debt instruments used of the public portion On January 26, 2016, debt held by the public was $13.62 trillion or about 75% of the previous 12 months of GDP. [5] [6] [7] [8] Intragovernmental holdings stood at $5.34 trillion, giving a combined total gross national debt of $18.96 trillion or about 104% of the previous 12 months of GDP. [7] The national debt can also be classified into marketable or non-marketable securities. Most of the marketable securities are Treasury notes, bills, and bonds held by investors and governments globally. The non-marketable securities are mainly the \"government account series\" owed to certain government trust funds such as the Social Security Trust Fund , which represented $2.74 trillion in 2011. [11] The non-marketable securities represent amounts owed to program beneficiaries. For example, in the case of the Social Security Trust Fund, the payroll taxes dedicated to Social Security were credited to the Trust Fund upon receipt, but spent for other purposes. If the government continues to run deficits in other parts of the budget, the government will have to issue debt held by the public to fund the Social Security Trust Fund, in effect exchanging one type of debt for the other. [12] Other large intragovernmental holders include the Federal Housing Administration, the Federal Savings and Loan Corporation's Resolution Fund and the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund (Medicare). [ citation needed ] Accounting treatment [ edit ] U.S. debt from 1940 to 2016. Red lines indicate the \"debt held by the public\" and black lines indicate the total national debt or gross public debt. The difference is the \"intragovernmental debt,\" which includes obligations to government programs such as Social Security. Stated as a formula, National Debt = Debt held by the Public + Intragovernmental Debt. The second panel shows the two debt figures as a percentage of U.S. GDP (dollar value of U.S. economic production for that year). The top panel is deflated so every year is in 2010 dollars Only debt held by the public is reported as a liability on the consolidated financial statements of the United States government. Debt held by government accounts is an asset to those accounts but a liability to the Treasury; they offset each other in the consolidated financial statements. [13] Government receipts and expenditures are normally presented on a cash rather than an accrual basis, although the accrual basis may provide more information on the longer-term implications of the government's annual operations. [14] The United States public debt is often expressed as a ratio of public debt to gross domestic product (GDP). The ratio of debt to GDP may decrease as a result of a government surplus as well as due to growth of GDP and inflation. [ citation needed ] Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac obligations excluded [ edit ] See also: Federal takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Under normal accounting rules, fully owned companies would be consolidated into the books of the owner, but the large size of Fannie and Freddie has made the U.S. government reluctant to incorporate Freddie and Fannie into its own books. When Freddie and Fannie required bail-outs, White House Budget Director Jim Nussle, on September 12, 2008, initially indicated their budget plans would not incorporate the GSE debt into the budget because of the temporary nature of the conservator intervention. [15] As the intervention has dragged out, pundits have started to further question this accounting treatment, noting that changes in August 2012 \"makes them even more permanent wards of the state and turns the government's preferred stock into a permanent, perpetual kind of security\". [16] The government controls the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board , which would normally criticize inconsistent accounting practices, but it does not oversee its own government's accounting practices or the standards set by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board . The on- or off-balance sheet obligations of those two independent GSEs was just over $5\u00a0trillion at the time the conservatorship was put in place, consisting mainly of mortgage payment guarantees and agency bonds . [17] The confusing independent but government-controlled status of the GSEs has resulted in investors of the legacy common shares and preferred shares launching various activist campaigns in 2014. [18] Guaranteed obligations excluded [ edit ] See also: Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program and Exchange Stabilization Fund U.S. federal government guarantees are not included in the public debt total, until such time as there is a call on the guarantees. For example, the U.S. federal government in late-2008 guaranteed large amounts of obligations of mutual funds, banks, and corporations under several programs designed to deal with the problems arising from the late-2000s financial crisis . The guarantee program lapsed at the end of 2012 when Congress declined to extend the scheme. The funding of direct investments made in response to the crisis, such as those made under the Troubled Assets Relief Program , are included in the debt. Unfunded obligations excluded [ edit ] The U.S. government is obligated under current law to make mandatory payments for programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) projects that payouts for these programs will significantly exceed tax revenues over the next 75 years. The Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) payouts already exceed program tax revenues, and social security payouts exceeded payroll taxes in fiscal 2010. These deficits require funding from other tax sources or borrowing. [19] The present value of these deficits or unfunded obligations is an estimated $45.8\u00a0trillion. This is the amount that would have had to be set aside in 2009 in order to pay for the unfunded obligations which, under current law, will have to be raised by the government in the future. Approximately $7.7\u00a0trillion relates to Social Security, while $38.2\u00a0trillion relates to Medicare and Medicaid. In other words, health care programs will require nearly five times more funding than Social Security. Adding this to the national debt and other federal obligations would bring total obligations to nearly $62\u00a0trillion. [20] However, these unfunded obligations are not counted in the national debt, as shown in monthly Treasury reports of the national debt. [21] Measuring debt burden [ edit ] GDP is a measure of the total size and output of the economy. One measure of the debt burden is its size relative to GDP, called the \" debt-to-GDP ratio .\" Mathematically, this is the debt divided by the GDP amount. The Congressional Budget Office includes historical budget and debt tables along with its annual \"Budget and Economic Outlook.\" Debt held by the public as a percentage of GDP rose from 34.7% GDP in 2000 to 40.5% in 2008 and 67.7% in 2011. [22] Mathematically, the ratio can decrease even while debt grows, if the rate of increase in GDP (which also takes account of inflation) is higher than the rate of increase of debt. Conversely, the debt to GDP ratio can increase even while debt is being reduced, if the decline in GDP is sufficient. According to the CIA World Factbook , during 2015, the U.S. debt to GDP ratio of 73.6% was the 39th highest in the world. This was measured using \"debt held by the public.\" [23] However, $1 trillion in additional borrowing since the end of FY 2015 has raised the ratio to 76.2% as of April 2016 [See Appendix#National debt for selected years]. Also, this number excludes state and local debt. According to the OECD, general government gross debt (federal, state, and local) in the United States in the fourth quarter of 2015 was $22.5 trillion (125% of GDP); subtracting out $5.25 trillion for intergovernmental federal debt to count only federal \"debt held by the public\" gives 96% of GDP. [24] The ratio is higher if the total national debt is used, by adding the \"intragovernmental debt\" to the \"debt held by the public.\" For example, on April 29, 2016, debt held by the public was approximately $13.84 trillion or about 76% of GDP. Intra-governmental holdings stood at $5.35 trillion, giving a combined total public debt of $19.19 trillion. U.S. GDP for the previous 12 months was approximately $18.15 trillion, for a total debt to GDP ratio of approximately 106%. [25] Calculating the annual change in debt [ edit ] Comparison of deficits to change in debt in 2008 Conceptually, an annual deficit (or surplus) should represent the change in the national debt, with a deficit adding to the national debt and a surplus reducing it. However, there is complexity in the budgetary computations that can make the deficit figure commonly reported in the media (the \"total deficit\") considerably different from the annual increase in the debt. The major categories of differences are the treatment of the Social Security program, Treasury borrowing, and supplemental appropriations outside the budget process. [26] Social Security payroll taxes and benefit payments, along with the net balance of the U.S. Postal Service , are considered \"off-budget\", while most other expenditure and receipt categories are considered \"on-budget\". The total federal deficit is the sum of the on-budget deficit (or surplus) and the off-budget deficit (or surplus). Since FY1960, the federal government has run on-budget deficits except for FY1999 and FY2000, and total federal deficits except in FY1969 and FY1998\u2013FY2001. [27] For example, in January 2009 the CBO reported that for fiscal year 2008 (FY2008) the \"on-budget deficit\" was $638 billion, offset by an \"off-budget surplus\" (mainly due to Social Security revenue in excess of payouts) of $183 billion, for a \"total deficit\" of $455 billion. This latter figure was the one commonly reported in the media. However, an additional $313 billion was required for \"the Treasury actions aimed at stabilizing the financial markets,\" an unusually high amount due to the Subprime mortgage crisis . This meant that the \"debt held by the public\" increased by $768 billion ($455B + $313B = $768B). The \"off-budget surplus\" was borrowed and spent (as is typically the case), increasing the \"intra-governmental debt\" by $183 billion. So the total increase in the \"National debt\" in FY2008 was $768B +$183B = $951 billion. [26] The Treasury Department reported an increase in the National Debt of $1,017B for FY2008. [28] The $66 billion difference is likely due to \"supplemental appropriations\" for the War on Terror, some of which were outside the budget process entirely until President Obama began including most of them in his FY2010 budget. [29] In other words, spending the \"off budget\" Social Security surplus adds to the total national debt (by increasing the intragovernmental debt) while the \"off-budget\" surplus reduces the \"total\" deficit reported in the media. Certain spending called \"supplemental appropriations\" is outside the budget process entirely but adds to the national debt. Funding for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars was accounted for this way prior to the Obama administration. [29] Certain stimulus measures and earmarks were also outside the budget process. The federal government publishes the total debt owed (public and intragovernmental holdings) monthly. [30] Reduction [ edit ] Negative real interest rates [ edit ] Since 2010, the U.S. Treasury has been obtaining negative real interest rates on government debt, meaning the inflation rate is greater than the interest rate paid on the debt. [31] Such low rates, outpaced by the inflation rate , occur when the market believes that there are no alternatives with sufficiently low risk, or when popular institutional investments such as insurance companies, pensions , or bond, money market, and balanced mutual funds are required or choose to invest sufficiently large sums in Treasury securities to hedge against risk. [32] [33] Economist Lawrence Summers has stated that at such low interest rates, government borrowing actually saves taxpayer money and improves creditworthiness. [34] In the late 1940s through the early 1970s, the US and UK both reduced their debt burden by about 30% to 40% of GDP per decade by taking advantage of negative real interest rates, but there is no guarantee that government debt rates will continue to stay so low. [32] [35] Between 1946 and 1974, the US debt-to-GDP ratio fell from 121% to 32% even though there were surpluses in only eight of those years which were much smaller than the deficits. [36] Raising reserve requirements and full reserve banking [ edit ] The two economists, Jaromir Benes and Michael Kumhof, working for the International Monetary Fund , published a working paper called The Chicago Plan Revisited suggesting that the debt could be eliminated by raising bank reserve requirements and converting from fractional reserve banking to full reserve banking . [37] [38] Economists at the Paris School of Economics have commented on the plan, stating that it is already the status quo for coinage currency, [39] and a Norges Bank economist has examined the proposal in the context of considering the finance industry as part of the real economy . [40] A Centre for Economic Policy Research paper agrees with the conclusion that, \"no real liability is created by new fiat money creation, and therefore public debt does not rise as a result\". [41] Debt ceiling [ edit ] Main article: United States debt ceiling The debt ceiling is a legislative mechanism to limit the amount of national debt that can be issued by the Treasury. In effect, it will restrain the Treasury from paying for expenditures after the limit has been reached, even if the expenditures have already been approved (in the budget) and have been appropriated. If this situation were to occur, it is unclear whether Treasury would be able to prioritize payments on debt to avoid a default on its debt obligations, but it would have to default on some of its non-debt obligations. Debt holdings [ edit ] This section does not cite any sources . Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . (August 2016) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) Estimated ownership each year Because a large variety of people own the notes, bills, and bonds in the \"public\" portion of the debt, Treasury also publishes information that groups the types of holders by general categories to portray who owns United States debt. In this data set, some of the public portion is moved and combined with the total government portion, because this amount is owned by the Federal Reserve as part of United States monetary policy. (See Federal Reserve System .) As is apparent from the chart, a little less than half of the total national debt is owed to the \"Federal Reserve and intragovernmental holdings\".

(November 2016) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) Composition of U.S. Long-Term Treasury Debt 2000\u20132014, from U. S. Department of the Treasury, TIC reporting system As of September 2014, foreigners owned $6.06\u00a0trillion of U.S. debt, or approximately 47% of the debt held by the public of $12.8\u00a0trillion and 34% of the total debt of $17.8\u00a0trillion. [42] The largest holders were China, Japan, Belgium, the Caribbean banking centers, and oil exporters. [44] The share held by foreign governments has grown over time, rising from 13% of the public debt in 1988 [45] to 25% in 2007. [46] As of September 2014 the largest single holder of U.S. government debt was China, with 21% of all foreign-held U.S. Treasury securities (10% of total U.S. public debt). [47] China's holdings of government debt, as a percentage of all foreign-held government debt are up significantly since 2000 (when China held just 6 percent of all foreign-held U.S. Treasury securities). [48] This exposure to potential financial or political risk should foreign banks stop buying Treasury securities or start selling them heavily was addressed in a June 2008 report issued by the Bank of International Settlements , which stated, \"Foreign investors in U.S. dollar assets have seen big losses measured in dollars, and still bigger ones measured in their own currency. While unlikely, indeed highly improbable for public sector investors, a sudden rush for the exits cannot be ruled out completely.\" [49] On May 20, 2007, Kuwait discontinued pegging its currency exclusively to the dollar, preferring to use the dollar in a basket of currencies. [ citation needed ] Syria made a similar announcement on June 4, 2007. [50] In September 2009 China, India and Russia said they were interested in buying International Monetary Fund gold to diversify their dollar-denominated securities. [51] However, in July 2010 China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange \"ruled out the option of dumping its vast holdings of US Treasury securities\" and said gold \"cannot become a main channel for investing our foreign exchange reserves\" because the market for gold is too small and prices are too volatile. [ citation needed ] According to Paul Krugman , \"It's true that foreigners now hold large claims on the United States, including a fair amount of government debt. But every dollar's worth of foreign claims on America is matched by 89 cents' worth of U.S. claims on foreigners. And because foreigners tend to put their U.S. investments into safe, low-yield assets, America actually earns more from its assets abroad than it pays to foreign investors. If your image is of a nation that's already deep in hock to the Chinese, you've been misinformed. Nor are we heading rapidly in that direction.\" [52] Forecasting [ edit ] Further information: United States federal budget CBO: Public Debt Under \"Extended\" and \"Alternate\" Scenarios Spending for mandatory programs is projected to rise relative to GDP, while discretionary programs decline Interest to GDP, a measure of debt burden, was very low in 2015 but is projected to rise with both interest rates and debt levels over the 2016\u20132026 period. CBO short-term outlook [ edit ] The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reported in its February 2014 Budget and Economic Outlook (which covers the 2014\u20132024 period) that deficits were projected to return to approximately the historical average relative to the size of the economy (GDP) by 2014. The CBO estimated that under current law, the deficit would total $514 billion in fiscal year 2014 or 3.0% GDP. Deficits would then slowly begin rising again through 2024 due primarily to the pressures of an aging population and rising healthcare costs per person. The debt to GDP ratio would remain stable for much of the decade then begin rising again toward the end of the 10-year forecast window, from 74% in 2014 to 79% in 2024. [53] CBO long-term outlook [ edit ] The CBO reports its Long-Term Budget Outlook annually, providing at least two scenarios for spending, revenue, deficits, and debt. The 2014 Outlook mainly covers the 25-year period through 2039. The \"extended baseline scenario\" assumes that the laws currently on the books will be implemented, for the most part. The CBO reported in July 2014 that under this scenario: If current laws remained generally unchanged in the future, federal debt held by the public would decline slightly relative to GDP over the next few years. After that, however, growing budget deficits would push debt back to and above its current high level. Twenty-five years from now, in 2039, federal debt held by the public would exceed 100 percent of GDP. Moreover, debt would be on an upward path relative to the size of the economy, a trend that could not be sustained indefinitely. By 2039, the deficit would equal 6.5 percent of GDP, larger than in any year between 1947 and 2008, and federal debt held by the public would reach 106 percent of GDP, more than in any year except 1946\u2014even without factoring in the economic effects of growing debt. [54] The \"extended alternative fiscal scenario\" assumes the continuation of present trends, which result in a more unfavorable debt position and adverse economic consequences relative to the baseline scenario. The CBO reported in July 2014 that under this scenario: [C]ertain policies that are now in place but are scheduled to change under current law are assumed to continue, and some provisions of current law that might be difficult to sustain for a long period are assumed to be modified. Under that scenario, deficits excluding interest payments would be about $2 trillion larger over the first decade than those under the baseline; subsequently, such deficits would be larger than those under the extended baseline by rapidly increasing amounts, doubling as a percentage of GDP in less than 10 years. CBO projects that real GNP in 2039 would be about 5 percent lower under the extended alternative fiscal scenario than under the extended baseline with economic feedback, and that interest rates would be about three-quarters of a percentage point higher. Reflecting the budgetary effects of those economic developments, federal debt would rise to 183 percent of GDP in 2039. [54] Over the long-term, the CBO projects that interest expense and mandatory spending categories (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security) will continue to grow relative to GDP, while discretionary categories (e.g., Defense and other Cabinet Departments) continue to fall relative to GDP. Debt is projected to continue rising relative to GDP under the above two scenarios, although the CBO did also offer other scenarios that involved austerity measures that would bring the debt to GDP ratio down. [54] The CBO estimated under the baseline scenario that the U.S. debt held by the public would increase approximately $8.5 trillion between the end of 2014 and 2024. Under a $2 trillion deficit reduction scenario during that first decade, federal debt held by the public in 2039 would stand at 75 percent of GDP, only slightly above the value of 72 percent at the end of 2013. Under a $4 trillion deficit reduction scenario for that decade, federal debt held by the public would fall to 42 percent of GDP in 2039. By comparison, such debt was 35 percent of GDP in 2007 and has averaged 39 percent of GDP during the past 40 years. [54] The CBO reported in September 2011: \"The nation cannot continue to sustain the spending programs and policies of the past with the tax revenues it has been accustomed to paying. Citizens will either have to pay more for their government, accept less in government services and benefits, or both.\" [55] Risks and debates [ edit ] Risks due to increasing entitlement spending, according to GAO's projections of future trends See also: Political debates about the United States federal budget and Deficit reduction in the United States CBO risk factors [ edit ] The CBO reported several types of risk factors related to rising debt levels in a July 2010 publication: A growing portion of savings would go towards purchases of government debt, rather than investments in productive capital goods such as factories and computers, leading to lower output and incomes than would otherwise occur; If higher marginal tax rates were used to pay rising interest costs, savings would be reduced and work would be discouraged; Rising interest costs would force reductions in government programs; Restrictions to the ability of policymakers to use fiscal policy to respond to economic challenges; and An increased risk of a sudden fiscal crisis, in which investors demand higher interest rates. [56] Concerns over Chinese holdings of U.S. debt [ edit ] Many American and other economic analysts have expressed concerns on account of the People's Republic of China's \"extensive\" holdings of United States government debt , [57] [58] as part of their reserves. The National Defense Authorization Act of the fiscal year 2012 included a provision requiring the Secretary of Defense to conduct a \"national security risk assessment of U.S. federal debt held by China.\" The Department issued its report in July 2012, stating that \"attempting to use U.S. Treasury securities as a coercive tool would have limited effect and likely would do more harm to China than to the United States. As the threat is not credible and the effect would be limited even if carried out, it does not offer China deterrence options, whether in the diplomatic, military, or economic realms, and this would remain true both in peacetime and in scenarios of crisis or war.\" [59] The 112th United States Congress introduced legislation whose aim was the assessment of the implications of China's ownership of U.S. debt. [59] The 2013 Report claimed that \"[a] potentially serious short-term problem would emerge if China decided to suddenly reduce their liquid U.S. financial assets significantly\" [emphasis in the original text], noting, also, that Federal Reserve System Chairman Ben Bernanke had, in 2007, stated that \"because foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury securities represent only a small part of total U.S. credit market debt outstanding, U.S. credit markets should be able to absorb without great difficulty any shift of foreign allocations.\" [59] A significant number of economists and analysts dismiss any and all concerns over foreign holdings of United States government debt denominated in U.S. dollars , including China's holdings. [60] [61] [62] [63] Sustainability [ edit ] According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the United States is on a \"fiscally unsustainable\" path because of projected future increases in Medicare and Social Security spending. [19] Risks to economic growth [ edit ] Debt levels may affect economic growth rates. In 2010, economists Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart reported that among the 20 developed countries studied, average annual GDP growth was 3\u20134% when debt was relatively moderate or low (i.e. under 60% of GDP), but it dips to just 1.6% when debt was high (i.e., above 90% of GDP). [64] In April 2013, the conclusions of Rogoff and Reinhart's study came into question when a coding error in their original paper was discovered by Herndon, Ash and Pollin of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst . [65] [66] Herndon, Ash and Pollin found that after correcting for errors and unorthodox methods used, there was no evidence that debt above a specific threshold reduces growth. [67] Reinhart and Rogoff maintain that after correcting for errors, a negative relationship between high debt and growth remains. [68] However, other economists, including Paul Krugman , have argued that it is low growth which causes national debt to increase, rather than the other way around. [69] [70] [71] Commenting on fiscal sustainability , former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke stated in April 2010 that \"Neither experience nor economic theory clearly indicates the threshold at which government debt begins to endanger prosperity and economic stability. But given the significant costs and risks associated with a rapidly rising federal debt, our nation should soon put in place a credible plan for reducing deficits to sustainable levels over time.\" [72] Interest and debt service costs [ edit ] Components of interest on the debt Despite rising debt levels, interest costs have remained at approximately 2008 levels (around $450 billion in total) due to lower than long-term interest rates paid on government debt in recent years. [73] However, interest rates may return to higher historical levels. [74] The cost of servicing the U.S. national debt can be measured in various ways. The CBO analyzes net interest as a percentage of GDP, with a higher percentage indicating a higher interest payment burden. During 2015, this was 1.3% GDP, close to the record low 1.2% of the 1966\u20131968 era. The average from 1966 to 2015 was 2.0% of GDP. [75] However, the CBO estimated in 2016 that the interest amounts and\u00a0% GDP will increase significantly over the following decade as both interest rates and debt levels rise: \"Interest payments on that debt represent a large and rapidly growing expense of the federal government. CBO's baseline shows net interest payments more than tripling under current law, climbing from $231 billion in 2014, or 1.3 percent of GDP, to $799 billion in 2024, or 3.0 percent of GDP\u2014the highest ratio since 1996.\" [76] Definition of public debt [ edit ] Economists also debate the definition of public debt. Krugman argued in May 2010 that the debt held by the public is the right measure to use, while Reinhart has testified to the President's Fiscal Reform Commission that gross debt is the appropriate measure. [69] The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) cited research by several economists supporting the use of the lower debt held by the public figure as a more accurate measure of the debt burden, disagreeing with these Commission members. [77] There is debate regarding the economic nature of the intragovernmental debt, which was approximately $4.6\u00a0trillion in February 2011. [78] For example, the CBPP argues: that \"large increases in [debt held by the public] can also push up interest rates and increase the amount of future interest payments the federal government must make to lenders outside of the United States, which reduces Americans' income. By contrast, intragovernmental debt (the other component of the gross debt) has no such effects because it is simply money the federal government owes (and pays interest on) to itself.\" [77] However, if the U.S. government continues to run \"on budget\" deficits as projected by the CBO and OMB for the foreseeable future, it will have to issue marketable Treasury bills and bonds (i.e., debt held by the public) to pay for the projected shortfall in the Social Security program. This will result in \"debt held by the public\" replacing \"intragovernmental debt\". [79] [80] Intergenerational equity [ edit ] See also: Intergenerational equity 1979 $10,000 Treasury Bond One debate about the national debt relates to intergenerational equity. For example, if one generation is receiving the benefit of government programs or employment enabled by deficit spending and debt accumulation, to what extent does the resulting higher debt impose risks and costs on future generations? There are several factors to consider: For every dollar of debt held by the public, there is a government obligation (generally marketable Treasury securities) counted as an asset by investors. Future generations benefit to the extent these assets are passed on to them. [81] As of 2010, approximately 72% of the financial assets were held by the wealthiest 5% of the population. [82] This presents a wealth and income distribution question, as only a fraction of the people in future generations will receive principal or interest from investments related to the debt incurred today. To the extent the U.S. debt is owed to foreign investors (approximately half the \"debt held by the public\" during 2012), principal and interest are not directly received by U.S. heirs. [81] Higher debt levels imply higher interest payments, which create costs for future taxpayers (e.g., higher taxes, lower government benefits, higher inflation, or increased risk of fiscal crisis). [56] To the extent the borrowed funds are invested today to improve the long-term productivity of the economy and its workers, such as via useful infrastructure projects or education, future generations may benefit. [83] For every dollar of intragovernmental debt, there is an obligation to specific program recipients, generally non-marketable securities such as those held in the Social Security Trust Fund. Adjustments that reduce future deficits in these programs may also apply costs to future generations, via higher taxes or lower program spending. [ citation needed ] Krugman wrote in March 2013 that by neglecting public investment and failing to create jobs, we are doing far more harm to future generations than merely passing along debt: \"Fiscal policy is, indeed, a moral issue, and we should be ashamed of what we're doing to the next generation's economic prospects. But our sin involves investing too little, not borrowing too much.\" Young workers face high unemployment and studies have shown their income may lag throughout their careers as a result. Teacher jobs have been cut, which could affect the quality of education and competitiveness of younger Americans. [84] Credit default [ edit ] The US has never fully defaulted. [85] [86] In April 1979, however, the United States may have technically defaulted on $122 million in Treasury bills , which was less than 1% of U.S. debt. The Treasury Department characterized it as a delay rather than as a default, but it did have consequences for short-term interest rates, which jumped 0.6%. [87] Others view it as a temporary, partial default.

Fiscal years 1940\u20132009 GDP figures were derived from February 2011 Office of Management and Budget figures which contained revisions of prior year figures due to significant changes from prior GDP measurements. Fiscal years 1950\u20132010 GDP measurements were derived from December 2010 Bureau of Economic Analysis figures which also tend to be subject to revision, especially more recent years. Afterwards the OMB figures were revised back to 2004 and the BEA figures (in a revision dated July 31, 2013) were revised back to 1947. Regarding estimates recorded in the GDP column (the last column) marked with a \"~\" symbol, absolute differences from advance (one month after) BEA reports of GDP percent change to current findings (as of November 2013) found in revisions are stated to be 1.3% \u00b1 2.0% or a 95% probability of being within the range of 0.0\u20133.3%, assuming the differences to occur according to standard deviations from the average absolute difference of 1.3%. E.g. with an advance report of a $400\u00a0billion increase of a $10\u00a0trillion GDP, for example, one could be 95% confident that the range in which the exact GDP dollar amount lies would be 0.0 to 3.3% different than 4.0% (400 \u00f7 10,000) or within the range of $0 to $330\u00a0billion different than the hypothetical $400\u00a0billion (a range of $70\u2013730 billion). Two months after, with a revised value, the range of potential difference from the stated estimate shrinks, and three months after with another revised value the range shrinks again. Fiscal years 1940\u20131970 begin July 1 of the previous year (for example, Fiscal Year 1940 begins July 1, 1939 and ends June 30, 1940); fiscal years 1980\u20132010 begin October 1 of the previous year.

[115] Total U.S Consumer Credit Card revolving credit was $931.0\u00a0billion in April 2009. [116] The U.S. balance of trade deficit in goods and services was $725.8\u00a0billion in 2005. [117] According to the U.S. Department of Treasury Preliminary 2014 Annual Report on U.S. Holdings of Foreign Securities, the United States valued its foreign treasury securities portfolio at $2.7 trillion. The largest debtors are Canada, the United Kingdom, Cayman Islands, and Australia, whom account for $1.2 trillion of sovereign debt owed to residents of the U.S. [118] The entire public debt in 1998 was attributable to the cost of research, development, and deployment of U.S. nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons-related programs during the Cold War . [119] [120] [121] A 1998 Brookings Institution study published by the Nuclear Weapons Cost Study Committee (formed in 1993 by the W. Alton Jones Foundation ), calculated that total expenditures for U.S. nuclear weapons from 1940 to 1998 was $5.5 trillion in 1996 Dollars. [119] The total public debt at the end of fiscal year 1998 was $5,478,189,000,000 in 1998 Dollars [122] or $5.3 trillion in 1996 Dollars.

The figures for this table were corrected the next week with changes to figures in those fiscal years. On July 30, 2015 the BEA released a revision to 2012\u20132015 GDP figures. The figures for this table were corrected on that day with changes to FY 2013 and 2014, but not 2015 as FY 2015 is updated within a week with the release of debt totals for July 31, 2015. On June 25, 2014 the BEA announced a 15-year revision of GDP figures would take place on July 31, 2014. The figures for this table were corrected after that date with changes to FY 2000, 2003, 2008, 2012, 2013 and 2014. The more precise FY 1999\u20132014 debt figures are derived from Treasury audit results. The variations in the 1990s and FY 2015 figures are due to double-sourced or relatively preliminary GDP figures respectively. A comprehensive revision GDP revision dated July 31, 2013 was described on the Bureau of Economic Analysis website. In November 2013 the total debt and yearly debt as a percentage of GDP columns of this table were changed to reflect those revised GDP figures.

When the summer comes to an end, Sandy, who is going back to Australia, frets that they may never meet again, but Danny tells her that their love is \"only the beginning\", and they will stay friends. The film moves to the start of the new school year at Rydell High School (\"Grease\"). Danny, a greaser , is a member of the T-Birds, consisting of his best friend Kenickie ( Jeff Conaway ), Doody ( Barry Pearl ), Sonny ( Michael Tucci ), and Putzie ( Kelly Ward ). The Pink Ladies, a sassy, popular clique of girls, also arrive, consisting of Rizzo ( Stockard Channing ), Frenchy ( Didi Conn ), Marty ( Dinah Manoff ), and Jan ( Jamie Donnelly ). After her parents unexpectedly decide to move from Australia, Sandy enrolls at Rydell and is befriended by Frenchy, who considers dropping out of high school to become a beautician by going to a beauty school. Unaware of each other's presence at Rydell, Danny and Sandy tell their curious groups the accounts of events during the pair's brief romance, without initially mentioning the other's name. Sandy's version emphasizes the romance of the affair, and the truth and purity, while Danny's version is more sexual (and therefore presumably less honest) (\"Summer Nights\" song). When Sandy finally tells everyone it was Danny Zuko, Rizzo arranges a surprise reunion for the two at a pep rally, where Sandy is cheering along with high-achiever and resident swot, Patty Simcox ( Susan Buckner ). At the rally, Sandy catches the eye of a muscly member of the football team ( Lorenzo Lamas ). When Sandy and Danny are reunited, they are initially elated, but Danny soon slips back into his greaser attitude, which offends Sandy. At the same rally, Kenickie reveals his new car, a dilapidated used jalopy, and announces he has entered it into a \"pinks\" street race at Thunder Road. Frenchy invites Sandy to her house for a sleepover. Sandy vomits at trying her first cigarette, drinking a dessert wine, and getting her ears pierced by Frenchy. While she recovers in the bathroom, Rizzo makes fun of her innocent and virtuous nature (\"Look At Me, I'm Sandra Dee\"). The T-Birds arrive in Kenickie's car, and Rizzo departs with Kenickie, leaving the other T-Birds stranded. Sandy laments over her feelings towards Danny, despite his earlier behavior (\"Hopelessly Devoted to You\"). As Kenickie and Rizzo start making love, the condom Kenickie is using breaks. The two are also interrupted by Leo Balmudo ( Dennis C. Stewart ), leader of the T-Birds' rival gang, the Scorpions, and his tall and brash girlfriend Cha-Cha ( Annette Charles ). The next day, the T-Birds are looking over Kenickie's car, and although they are initially skeptical of its potential, Danny and Kenickie explain the modifications they could add to make it a hot-rodding sex machine (\"Greased Lightnin'\"). In an attempt to impress Sandy, Danny approaches Coach Calhoun ( Sid Caesar ) in an effort to become a high school athlete. Danny's pride and lack of experience lead to him picking fights with the jocks when he tries to play basketball, wrestling or baseball, so Calhoun suggests cross-country running, in which Danny excels. Danny's running proves to impress Sandy, prompting the two to reconcile for a date at the Frosty Palace; when the other greasers arrive, Danny and Sandy promptly leave in discomfort. Kenickie and a noticeably distressed Rizzo get into an argument and break up, while Putzie and Jan arrange to go to the dance. Left alone, Frenchy\u2014who dropped out of Rydell to enroll in beauty school, only to quit when she turned her own hair bright pink\u2014is visited by a guardian angel ( Frankie Avalon ) who advises her to return to Rydell (\"Beauty School Dropout\"). The school dance arrives, broadcast live on television and hosted by DJ Vince Fontaine ( Edd Byrnes ), who flirts with Marty. Rizzo and Kenickie attempt to spite one another by bringing Leo and Cha-Cha as their dates, while Danny and Sandy arrive together. Danny and Sandy dance well and appear to be on their way to winning the competition, but a drunken Sonny pulls Sandy off the floor partway through. Cha-Cha joins Danny for the rest of the dance, and the two win (\"Born to Hand Jive\"). During the last dance (\"Blue Moon\"), Putzie leads Sonny and Doody in a mooning of the national TV audience, which Principal McGee ( Eve Arden ) vows to put on their permanent records. Danny apologizes to Sandy and tries to make it up to her by taking her to a drive-in theater. She's unmoved by his pleas for forgiveness until he gives Sandy his ring, which she gleefully accepts. Moments later, Danny tries to aggressively make out with her, causing Sandy to angrily throw his ring at him and depart, leaving Danny distraught (\"Sandy\"). Meanwhile, because she skipped a period, Rizzo quietly admits she may be pregnant to Marty, who in turn tells Sonny, and the rumor spreads like wildfire through the drive-in, reaching Kenickie just as Rizzo is walking past. He attempts to talk to Rizzo about it, telling her he doesn't run away from his mistakes. Rizzo tells him it was someone else's mistake, a response that angers Kenickie. At school the next day, word of Rizzo's pregnancy fears reaches Patty Simcox, who has spread the gossip to her clique and sneers at Rizzo as they walk by. A visibly hurt Rizzo, who thanks Sandy for her offer of help, sings to herself about how her sins are not as bad as they could be (\"There Are Worse Things I Could Do\"). On the day of the race, Kenickie asks Danny to be on standby in case he decides to back out. Moments before the race is set to begin, Kenickie suffers a concussion when he bends over to pick up a penny for good luck and Putzie opens the car door on Kenickie's head, and Danny takes the helm of the car. Leo and Danny run a tight race, with Leo attempting to shred Danny's tires with bladed hubcaps (in a sequence paying homage to Ben-Hur ); Danny eventually wins when Leo skids out. Sandy watches from afar and concludes that she still loves Danny. She decides to change her attitude and image to impress him and asks Frenchy for help (\"Look At Me, I'm Sandra Dee (Reprise)\"). On the last day of school, a sobbing Principal McGee and her equally nostalgic assistant Blanche ( Dody Goodman ), in a speech over the intercom, tell the students that they could be future leaders. The school hosts a carnival where Sonny and Putzie learn that, because they either never took or failed physical education, they have to take summer school with Coach Calhoun in order to get their diplomas. Kenickie approaches Rizzo and demands to talk to her, only to have her reveal she is not pregnant after all. Overjoyed, they reunite. Danny shows up wearing a Letterman's sweater and reveals he is now a letterman for the cross-country team, to the T-Birds' dismay. Danny confesses it is a decision he has made in an effort to clean up his image so that he can be together with Sandy, telling the T-Birds that they too will have to grow up and stop following people all the time. The group is subsequently stunned when Sandy appears seconds later sporting a new hairstyle, dressed in black leather, and smoking a cigarette. In song, the two admit they love each other and reunite (\"You're the One That I Want\") and Sandy also tells Danny that if she was willing to change for him then it is only fair that he do the same for her by being faithful and more mature. The gang realizes that high school is now over, and worries that they'll never see each other again. Danny insists, \"Nah, that'll never happen,\" and everyone celebrates their friendship (\"We Go Together\"). As the song nears its conclusion, Danny and Sandy depart in a red hot rod, which takes flight, and the pair wave goodbye to their friends.

He made a number of casting recommendations that Stigwood ultimately accepted, including suggesting Randal Kleiser (who had never directed a theatrical feature before this but had directed Travolta in the 1976 telefilm The Boy in the Plastic Bubble ) as director, and Olivia Newton-John , then known almost exclusively as a country music singer, as Sandy. [4] Newton-John had done little acting before this film, with only one film credit (the unreleased 1970 film Toomorrow , which predated her singing breakthrough) to her name up to that time. Before accepting the role, Newton-John requested a screen test for Grease to avoid another career setback. [5] The screen test was done with the drive-in movie scene. Newton-John, who is native to England and lived most of her life in Australia, was unable to perform with a convincing American accent, and thus her character was rewritten to be Australian. Before Newton-John was hired, Allan Carr was considering numerous names such as Ann-Margret , Susan Dey and Marie Osmond for the lead role; Newton-John agreed to a reduced asking price in exchange for star billing. [5] In a case of life imitating art, Newton-John's own musical career would undergo a transformation similar to that of the Sandy Olsson character; her next album after Grease , the provocatively titled Totally Hot , featured a much more sexual and pop-oriented approach, with Newton-John appearing on the album cover in similar all-leather attire and teased hair. [6] Jeff Conaway , like Travolta, had previously appeared in the stage version of Grease ; he had played Danny Zuko during the show's run on Broadway. [7] Jamie Donnelly reprised her role as Jan from the Broadway show, the only cast member to do so; as her hair had begun to gray by this point, she had to dye her hair to resemble her stage character. [8] Kelly Ward had previously appeared as a similar sarcastic supporting character in The Boy in the Plastic Bubble with Travolta under Kleiser; the role was substantially rewritten from the musical. Whereas \"Rump\" in the musical sang lead on two songs and was particularly known for his mooning , the renamed \"Putzie\" did not sing and shares the mooning scene with two of the other T-Birds, Sonny and Doody. Lorenzo Lamas was a last-minute replacement for Steven Ford , who developed stage fright shortly before filming and backed out. His role contained no spoken dialogue and required Lamas to dye his hair blond to avoid looking like most of the other T-Birds (although Conaway and Ward were also blonds). [8] Henry Winkler was once considered for a lead in the film. Winkler, who was playing Arthur Fonzarelli on Happy Days , was originally chosen to play Danny. His lack of singing experience and fear of being typecast after Happy Days and the film The Lords of Flatbush led him to decline the role. [ citation needed ] Adult film star Harry Reems was originally signed to play Coach Calhoun; however, executives at Paramount nixed the idea due to Reems' previous work in adult films, and producers cast Sid Caesar instead. [9] Caesar was one of several veterans of 1950s television ( Eve Arden , Frankie Avalon , Joan Blondell , Edd Byrnes , Alice Ghostley , Dody Goodman ) to be cast in supporting roles. Coincidentally, Frankie Avalon and Randal Kleiser had both appeared in 1966's Fireball 500 , the latter as an extra. Filming locations [ edit ] The car race in the film took place at the Los Angeles River. The opening beach scene was shot at Malibu's Leo Carrillo State Beach , making explicit reference to From Here to Eternity . The exterior Rydell scenes, including the basketball, baseball and track segments, were shot at Venice High School in Venice, California , while the Rydell interiors, including the high school dance, were filmed at Huntington Park High School . The sleepover was shot at a private house in East Hollywood . The Paramount Pictures studio lot was the location of the scenes that involve Frosty Palace and the musical numbers \"Greased Lightning\" and \"Beauty School Dropout\". The drive-in movie scenes were shot at the Burbank Pickwick Drive-In (it was closed and torn down in 1989 and a shopping center took its place). The race was filmed at the Los Angeles River , between the First and Seventh Street Bridges, where many other films have been shot. [10] The final scene where the carnival took place used John Marshall High School . [11] And due to budget cuts a short scene was filmed at Hazard Park in Los Angeles. Post-production [ edit ] Scenes inside the Frosty Palace contain obvious blurring of various Coca-Cola signs. [12] Prior to the film's release, producer Allan Carr had made a product-placement deal with Coca-Cola's main competitor Pepsi (for example, a Pepsi logo can be seen in the animated opening sequence). When Carr saw the footage of the scene with Coca-Cola products and signage, he ordered director Randal Kleiser to either reshoot the scene with Pepsi products or remove the Coca-Cola logos from the scene. As reshoots were deemed too expensive and time-consuming, optical mattes were used to cover up or blur out the Coca-Cola references. The 'blurring' covered up trademarked menu signage and a large wall poster, but a red cooler with the logo could not be sufficiently altered so was left unchanged. According to Kleiser, \"We just had to hope that Pepsi wouldn't complain. They didn't.\" [13] [14] In the 2010 sing-along version (see below), the blurred Coke poster has been digitally removed. In its place is more of the wavy wall design that surrounded it. [ citation needed ] John Wilson did the animated title sequence for the start of the film. [ citation needed ] Release and reception [ edit ] Box office [ edit ] Grease was originally released to North American theaters on June 16, 1978 and was an immediate box office success. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $8,941,717 in 862 theaters in the United States and Canada, ranking at No. 2 (behind Jaws 2 ) at the box office. [15] Grease has grossed $188,755,690 domestically and $206,200,000 internationally, totaling $394,955,690 worldwide. Globally, it was the highest-grossing musical ever, eclipsing the 13-year-old record held by The Sound of Music , but has since been overtaken by Les Mis\u00e9rables , Mamma Mia! and the 2017 release of Beauty and the Beast . Grease is now the fourth highest-grossing live action musical. [16] Critical reception [ edit ] Grease received mostly positive reviews from movie critics [17] and is considered by many as one of the best films of 1978. [18] [19] [20] [21] Vincent Canby on its initial release in June 1978 called the film \"terrific fun\", describing it as a \"contemporary fantasy about a 1950s teen-age musical\u2014a larger, funnier, wittier and more imaginative-than-Hollywood movie with a life that is all its own\"; Canby pointed out that the film was \"somewhat in the manner of Close Encounters of the Third Kind , which recalls the science-fiction films of the '50s in a manner more elegant and more benign than anything that was ever made then, Grease is a multimillion-dollar evocation of the B-picture quickies that Sam Katzman used to turn out in the '50s ( Don't Knock the Rock , 1956) and that American International carried to the sea in the 1960s ( Beach Party , 1963).\" [22] Grease was voted the best musical ever on Channel 4 's 100 greatest musicals in 2004. [23] The film holds a 75% \"Certified Fresh\" rating on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes based on 61 critic reviews with an average rating of 6.6/10 and with a consensus that reads, \" Grease is a pleasing, energetic musical with infectiously catchy songs and an ode to young love that never gets old.\" [24] It holds a score of 70/100 on similar website Metacritic . [17] Grease premiered for the first time on American television in 1981 on ABC-TV . It was re-released to theaters in 1998 to mark the 20th anniversary. The film was also ranked number 21 on Entertainment Weekly ' s list of the 50 Best High School Movies. [25] [26] Home video [ edit ] This section does not cite any sources .

While only a few cast members from the original movie such as Dody Goodman, Sid Caesar, Eddie Deezen, Didi Conn, Dennis Stewart and Eve Arden reprise their respective roles. Dick Patterson returned, playing a different character. It was not as successful, grossing just $15 million on its $13 million budget. Patricia Birch, the original movie's choreographer, directed the ill-fated sequel. It would be the only movie that she would direct. On July 8, 2010, a sing-along version of Grease was released to select theaters around the U.S. [27] A trailer was released in May 2010, with cigarettes digitally removed from certain scenes, implying heavy editing; however, Paramount confirmed these changes were done only for the film's advertising, [28] and the rating for the film itself changed from its original PG to that of PG-13 for \"sexual content including references, teen smoking and drinking, and language.\" [29] The movie was shown for two weekends only; additional cities lobbied by fans from the Paramount official website started a week later and screened for one weekend. [30] On March 12, 2013, Grease and Grease 2 were packaged together in a Double Feature DVD set from Warner Home Video . Soundtrack [ edit ] Main article: Grease: The Original Soundtrack from the Motion Picture The soundtrack album ended 1978 as the second-best selling album of the year in the United States , exceeded only by another soundtrack album , from the film Saturday Night Fever , which also starred Travolta. [3] The song \"Hopelessly Devoted to You\" was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Music\u2014Original Song . The song \"You're the One That I Want\" was released as a single prior to the film's release and became an immediate chart-topper, despite not being in the stage show or having been seen in the film at that time. [31] Additionally, the dance number to \"You're the One That I Want\" was nominated for TV Land's award for \"Movie Dance Sequence You Reenacted in Your Living Room\" in 2008. [32] In the United Kingdom, the two Travolta/Newton-John duets, \"You're the One That I Want\" and \"Summer Nights\", were both number one hits and as of 2011 are still among the 20 best-selling singles of all time (at Nos. 6 and 19 respectively). [33] The movie's title song was also a number-one hit single for Frankie Valli . [34] The song \"Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee\" references Sal Mineo in the original stage version. Mineo was stabbed to death a year before filming, so the line was changed to refer to Elvis Presley instead. The references to Troy Donohue , Doris Day , Rock Hudson and Annette Funicello are from the original stage version. Coincidentally, this scene as well as the scene before and the scene after it were filmed on August 16, 1977, the date of Elvis Presley's death. [35] Some of the songs were not present in the film; songs that appear in the film but not in the soundtrack are \" La Bamba \" by Ritchie Valens, \"Whole Lotta Shaking Going On\" by Jerry Lee Lewis , \"Alma Mater\", \"Alma Mater Parody\", and \"Rydell Fight Song\". \"Alone at a Drive-in Movie (instrumental)\", \"Mooning\", and \"Freddy My Love\" are not present in the film, although all three are listed in the end credits in-addition to being on the soundtrack. (Both \"Mooning\" and \"Rock'n'Roll Party Queen,\" the latter of which was played in the film as background music, were written in the musical for a character named Roger that was written out of the film, replaced by the non-singing Putzie. In general, all of the songs in the musical that were performed by characters other than Danny, Rizzo, Sandy or Johnny Casino were either taken out of the film or given to other characters, including Marty Maraschino's number \"Freddy My Love,\" Kenickie's \"Greased Lightnin',\" and Doody's \"Those Magic Changes.\") The songs appear in the film in the following order: \" Love is a Many-Splendored Thing \" \" Grease \" \"Alma Mater\" \" Summer Nights \" \u2013 Danny, Sandy, Pink Ladies and T-Birds \"Rydell Fight Song\" \u2013 Rydell Marching Band \"Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee\" \u2013 Rizzo and Pink Ladies \" Hopelessly Devoted to You \" \u2013 Sandy \" Greased Lightnin' \" \u2013 Danny and T-Birds \" La Bamba \" \"It's Raining on Prom Night\" \" Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On \" \" Beauty School Dropout \" \u2013 Teen Angel and Female Angels \"Rock n' Roll Party Queen\" \"Rock n' Roll is Here to Stay\" \u2013 Johnny Casino and the Gamblers \" Those Magic Changes \" \u2013 Johnny Casino and the Gamblers; Danny sings along onscreen \" Tears on My Pillow \" \u2013 Johnny Casino and the Gamblers \" Hound Dog \" \u2013 Johnny Casino and the Gamblers \"Born to Hand Jive\" \u2013 Johnny Casino and the Gamblers \" Blue Moon \" \u2013 Johnny Casino and the Gamblers \" Sandy \" \u2013 Danny \" There Are Worse Things I Could Do \" \u2013 Rizzo \"Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee (Reprise)\" \u2013 Sandy \"Alma Mater Parody\" (instrumental) \" You're the One That I Want \" \u2013 Danny, Sandy, Pink Ladies, and T-Birds \"We Go Together\" \u2013 Cast \"Grease (Reprise)\" Television [ edit ] Main article: Somos t\u00fa y yo: un nuevo d\u00eda On August 17, 2009, a television series inspired by the film premiered in Venezuela. The series was produced and directed by Vladimir Perez. The show will explore and expand on the characters and story from the film.

For comparison, this Netgear dual-band router from 2013 uses the AC standard, capable of transmitting 1900\u00a0megabits per second (combined). IEEE 802.11 is a set of media access control (MAC) and physical layer (PHY) specifications for implementing wireless local area network (WLAN) computer communication in the 900\u00a0MHz and 2.4, 3.6 , 5, and 60\u00a0GHz frequency bands. They are created and maintained by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) LAN / MAN Standards Committee ( IEEE 802 ). The base version of the standard was released in 1997, and has had subsequent amendments. The standard and amendments provide the basis for wireless network products using the Wi-Fi brand. While each amendment is officially revoked when it is incorporated in the latest version of the standard, the corporate world tends to market to the revisions because they concisely denote capabilities of their products. As a result, in the marketplace, each revision tends to become its own standard.

Other standards in the family (c\u2013f, h, j) are service amendments that are used to extend the current scope of the existing standard, which may also include corrections to a previous specification. [1] 802.11b and 802.11g use the 2.4 GHz ISM band , operating in the United States under Part 15 of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission Rules and Regulations. Because of this choice of frequency band, 802.11b and g equipment may occasionally suffer interference from microwave ovens , cordless telephones , and Bluetooth devices. 802.11b and 802.11g control their interference and susceptibility to interference by using direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signaling methods, respectively. 802.11a uses the 5\u00a0GHz U-NII band , which, for much of the world, offers at least 23 non-overlapping channels rather than the 2.4\u00a0GHz ISM frequency band offering only three non-overlapping channels, where other adjacent channels overlap\u2014see list of WLAN channels . Better or worse performance with higher or lower frequencies (channels) may be realized, depending on the environment. 802.11n can use either the 2.4\u00a0GHz or the 5\u00a0GHz band; 802.11ac uses only the 5\u00a0GHz band. The segment of the radio frequency spectrum used by 802.11 varies between countries. In the US, 802.11a and 802.11g devices may be operated without a license, as allowed in Part 15 of the FCC Rules and Regulations. Frequencies used by channels one through six of 802.11b and 802.11g fall within the 2.4\u00a0GHz amateur radio band. Licensed amateur radio operators may operate 802.11b/g devices under Part 97 of the FCC Rules and Regulations, allowing increased power output but not commercial content or encryption. [2] History [ edit ] 802.11 technology has its origins in a 1985 ruling by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission that released the ISM band [1] for unlicensed use. [3] In 1991 NCR Corporation / AT&T (now Nokia Labs and LSI Corporation ) invented a precursor to 802.11 in Nieuwegein , the Netherlands. The inventors initially intended to use the technology for cashier systems. The first wireless products were brought to the market under the name WaveLAN with raw data rates of 1\u00a0Mbit/s and 2\u00a0Mbit/s. Vic Hayes , who held the chair of IEEE 802.11 for 10 years, and has been called the \"father of Wi-Fi\", was involved in designing the initial 802.11b and 802.11a standards within the IEEE . [4] In 1999, the Wi-Fi Alliance was formed as a trade association to hold the Wi-Fi trademark under which most products are sold.

C1 IEEE 802.11af about using white space spectrum for WiFi based on the PHY layer of 802.11ac 802.11-1997 (802.11 legacy) [ edit ] Main article: IEEE 802.11 (legacy mode) The original version of the standard IEEE 802.11 was released in 1997 and clarified in 1999, but is now obsolete. It specified two net bit rates of 1 or 2 megabits per second (Mbit/s), plus forward error correction code. It specified three alternative physical layer technologies: diffuse infrared operating at 1\u00a0Mbit/s; frequency-hopping spread spectrum operating at 1\u00a0Mbit/s or 2\u00a0Mbit/s; and direct-sequence spread spectrum operating at 1\u00a0Mbit/s or 2\u00a0Mbit/s. The latter two radio technologies used microwave transmission over the Industrial Scientific Medical frequency band at 2.4\u00a0GHz. Some earlier WLAN technologies used lower frequencies, such as the U.S. 900\u00a0MHz ISM band. Legacy 802.11 with direct-sequence spread spectrum was rapidly supplanted and popularized by 802.11b. 802.11a (OFDM waveform) [ edit ] Main article: IEEE 802.11a-1999 Originally described as clause 17 of the 1999 specification, the OFDM waveform at 5.8\u00a0GHz is now defined in clause 18 of the 2012 specification, and provides protocols that allow transmission and reception of data at rates of 1.5 to 54\u00a0Mbit/s. It has seen widespread worldwide implementation, particularly within the corporate workspace. While the original amendment is no longer valid, the term 802.11a is still used by wireless access point (cards and routers) manufacturers to describe interoperability of their systems at 5\u00a0GHz, 54\u00a0Mbit/s. The 802.11a standard uses the same data link layer protocol and frame format as the original standard, but an OFDM based air interface (physical layer). It operates in the 5\u00a0GHz band with a maximum net data rate of 54\u00a0Mbit/s, plus error correction code, which yields realistic net achievable throughput in the mid-20 Mbit/s. [14] Since the 2.4\u00a0GHz band is heavily used to the point of being crowded, using the relatively unused 5\u00a0GHz band gives 802.11a a significant advantage. However, this high carrier frequency also brings a disadvantage: the effective overall range of 802.11a is less than that of 802.11b/g. In theory, 802.11a signals are absorbed more readily by walls and other solid objects in their path due to their smaller wavelength, and, as a result, cannot penetrate as far as those of 802.11b. In practice, 802.11b typically has a higher range at low speeds (802.11b will reduce speed to 5.5\u00a0Mbit/s or even 1\u00a0Mbit/s at low signal strengths). 802.11a also suffers from interference, [15] but locally there may be fewer signals to interfere with, resulting in less interference and better throughput. 802.11b [ edit ] Main article: IEEE 802.11b-1999 The 802.11b standard has a maximum raw data rate of 11\u00a0Mbit/s, and uses the same media access method defined in the original standard. 802.11b products appeared on the market in early 2000, since 802.11b is a direct extension of the modulation technique defined in the original standard. The dramatic increase in throughput of 802.11b (compared to the original standard) along with simultaneous substantial price reductions led to the rapid acceptance of 802.11b as the definitive wireless LAN technology. Devices using 802.11b experience interference from other products operating in the 2.4\u00a0GHz band. Devices operating in the 2.4\u00a0GHz range include microwave ovens, Bluetooth devices, baby monitors, cordless telephones, and some amateur radio equipment. 802.11g [ edit ] Main article: IEEE 802.11g-2003 In June 2003, a third modulation standard was ratified: 802.11g. This works in the 2.4\u00a0GHz band (like 802.11b), but uses the same OFDM based transmission scheme as 802.11a. It operates at a maximum physical layer bit rate of 54\u00a0Mbit/s exclusive of forward error correction codes, or about 22\u00a0Mbit/s average throughput. [16] 802.11g hardware is fully backward compatible with 802.11b hardware, and therefore is encumbered with legacy issues that reduce throughput by ~21% when compared to 802.11a. [ citation needed ] The then-proposed 802.11g standard was rapidly adopted in the market starting in January 2003, well before ratification, due to the desire for higher data rates as well as to reductions in manufacturing costs. By summer 2003, most dual-band 802.11a/b products became dual-band/tri-mode, supporting a and b/g in a single mobile adapter card or access point. Details of making b and g work well together occupied much of the lingering technical process; in an 802.11g network, however, activity of an 802.11b participant will reduce the data rate of the overall 802.11g network. Like 802.11b, 802.11g devices suffer interference from other products operating in the 2.4\u00a0GHz band, for example wireless keyboards. 802.11-2007 [ edit ] In 2003, task group TGma was authorized to \"roll up\" many of the amendments to the 1999 version of the 802.11 standard. REVma or 802.11ma, as it was called, created a single document that merged 8 amendments ( 802.11a , b , d , e , g , h , i , j ) with the base standard. Upon approval on March 8, 2007, 802.11REVma was renamed to the then-current base standard IEEE 802.11-2007 . [17] 802.11n [ edit ] Main article: IEEE 802.11n-2009 802.11n is an amendment that improves upon the previous 802.11 standards by adding multiple-input multiple-output antennas (MIMO). 802.11n operates on both the 2.4\u00a0GHz and the 5\u00a0GHz bands. Support for 5\u00a0GHz bands is optional. It operates at a maximum net data rate from 54\u00a0Mbit/s to 600\u00a0Mbit/s. The IEEE has approved the amendment, and it was published in October 2009. [18] [19] Prior to the final ratification, enterprises were already migrating to 802.11n networks based on the Wi-Fi Alliance 's certification of products conforming to a 2007 draft of the 802.11n proposal. 802.11-2012 [ edit ] In May 2007, task group TGmb was authorized to \"roll up\" many of the amendments to the 2007 version of the 802.11 standard. [20] REVmb or 802.11mb, as it was called, created a single document that merged ten amendments ( 802.11k , r , y , n , w , p , z , v , u , s ) with the 2007 base standard. In addition much cleanup was done, including a reordering of many of the clauses. [21] Upon publication on March 29, 2012, the new standard was referred to as IEEE 802.11-2012 . 802.11ac [ edit ] Main article: IEEE 802.11ac IEEE 802.11ac-2013 is an amendment to IEEE 802.11, published in December 2013, that builds on 802.11n. [22] Changes compared to 802.11n include wider channels (80 or 160\u00a0MHz versus 40\u00a0MHz) in the 5\u00a0GHz band, more spatial streams (up to eight versus four), higher-order modulation (up to 256- QAM vs. 64-QAM), and the addition of Multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO). As of October 2013, high-end implementations support 80\u00a0MHz channels, three spatial streams, and 256-QAM, yielding a data rate of up to 433.3\u00a0Mbit/s per spatial stream, 1300\u00a0Mbit/s total, in 80\u00a0MHz channels in the 5\u00a0GHz band. [23] Vendors have announced plans to release so-called \"Wave 2\" devices with support for 160\u00a0MHz channels, four spatial streams, and MU-MIMO in 2014 and 2015. [24] [25] [26] 802.11ad [ edit ] This section needs to be updated . Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (November 2013) Main article: IEEE 802.11ad IEEE 802.11ad is an amendment that defines a new physical layer for 802.11 networks to operate in the 60\u00a0GHz millimeter wave spectrum. This frequency band has significantly different propagation characteristics than the 2.4\u00a0GHz and 5\u00a0GHz bands where Wi-Fi networks operate. Products implementing the 802.11ad standard are being brought to market under the WiGig brand name. The certification program is now being developed by the Wi-Fi Alliance instead of the now defunct WiGig Alliance. [27] The peak transmission rate of 802.11ad is 7\u00a0Gbit/s. [28] TP-Link announced the world's first 802.11ad router in January 2016. [29] 802.11af [ edit ] Main article: IEEE 802.11af IEEE 802.11af, also referred to as \"White-Fi\" and \"Super Wi-Fi\", [30] is an amendment, approved in February 2014, that allows WLAN operation in TV white space spectrum in the VHF and UHF bands between 54 and 790\u00a0MHz. [31] [32] It uses cognitive radio technology to transmit on unused TV channels, with the standard taking measures to limit interference for primary users, such as analog TV, digital TV, and wireless microphones. [32] Access points and stations determine their position using a satellite positioning system such as GPS , and use the Internet to query a geolocation database (GDB) provided by a regional regulatory agency to discover what frequency channels are available for use at a given time and position. [32] The physical layer uses OFDM and is based on 802.11ac. [33] The propagation path loss as well as the attenuation by materials such as brick and concrete is lower in the UHF and VHF bands than in the 2.4 and 5\u00a0GHz bands, which increases the possible range. [32] The frequency channels are 6 to 8\u00a0MHz wide, depending on the regulatory domain. [32] Up to four channels may be bonded in either one or two contiguous blocks. [32] MIMO operation is possible with up to four streams used for either space\u2013time block code (STBC) or multi-user (MU) operation. [32] The achievable data rate per spatial stream is 26.7\u00a0Mbit/s for 6 and 7\u00a0MHz channels, and 35.6\u00a0Mbit/s for 8\u00a0MHz channels. [10] With four spatial streams and four bonded channels, the maximum data rate is 426.7\u00a0Mbit/s for 6 and 7\u00a0MHz channels and 568.9\u00a0Mbit/s for 8\u00a0MHz channels. [10] 802.11ah [ edit ] Main article: IEEE 802.11ah IEEE 802.11ah defines a WLAN system operating at sub-1\u00a0GHz license-exempt bands, with final approval slated for September 2016. [31] [34] Due to the favorable propagation characteristics of the low frequency spectra, 802.11ah can provide improved transmission range compared with the conventional 802.11 WLANs operating in the 2.4\u00a0GHz and 5\u00a0GHz\u00a0bands. 802.11ah can be used for various purposes including large scale sensor networks, [35] extended range hotspot, and outdoor Wi-Fi for cellular traffic offloading, whereas the available bandwidth is relatively narrow. The protocol intends consumption to be competitive with low power Bluetooth , at a much wider range. [36] 802.11ai [ edit ] Main article: IEEE 802.11ai IEEE 802.11ai is an amendment to the 802.11 standard that added new mechanisms for a faster initial link setup time. [37] 802.11aj [ edit ] IEEE 802.11aj is a rebanding of 802.11ad for use in the 45\u00a0GHz unlicensed spectrum available in some regions of the world (specifically China). [37] 802.11aq [ edit ] IEEE 802.11aq is an amendment to the 802.11 standard that will enable pre-association discovery of services. This extends some of the mechanisms in 802.11u that enabled device discovery to further discover the services running on a device, or provided by a network. [37] 802.11ax [ edit ] Main article: IEEE 802.11ax IEEE 802.11ax is the successor to 802.11ac, and will increase the efficiency of WLAN networks. Currently in development, this project has the goal of providing 4x the throughput of 802.11ac. [38] 802.11ay [ edit ] Main article: IEEE 802.11ay This section needs to be updated . Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (March 2015) IEEE 802.11ay is a standard that is being developed. It is an amendment that defines a new physical layer for 802.11 networks to operate in the 60\u00a0GHz millimeter wave spectrum. It will be an extension of the existing 11ad, aimed to extend the throughput, range and use-cases. The main use-cases include: indoor operation, out-door back-haul and short range communications. The peak transmission rate of 802.11ay is 20\u00a0Gbit/s. [39] The main extensions include: channel bonding (2, 3 and 4), MIMO and higher modulation schemes. 802.11-2016 [ edit ] IEEE 802.11-2016 is a revision based on IEEE 802.11-2012, incorporating 5 amendments ( 11ae , 11aa , 11ad , 11ac , 11af ). In addition, existing MAC and PHY functions have been enhanced and obsolete features were removed or marked for removal. Some clauses and annexes have been renumbered. [40] Common misunderstandings about achievable throughput [ edit ] Graphical representation of Wi-Fi application specific ( UDP ) performance envelope 2.4\u00a0GHz band, with 802.11g Across all variations of 802.11, maximum achievable throughputs are given either based on measurements under ideal conditions or in the layer-2 data rates. This, however, does not apply to typical deployments in which data is being transferred between two endpoints, of which at least one is typically connected to a wired infrastructure and the other endpoint is connected to an infrastructure via a wireless link. Graphical representation of Wi-Fi application specific ( UDP ) performance envelope 2.4\u00a0GHz band, with 802.11n with 40MHz This means that, typically, data frames pass an 802.11 (WLAN) medium, and are being converted to 802.3 ( Ethernet ) or vice versa. Due to the difference in the frame (header) lengths of these two media, the application's packet size determines the speed of the data transfer. This means applications that use small packets (e.g., VoIP) create dataflows with high-overhead traffic (i.e., a low goodput ). Other factors that contribute to the overall application data rate are the speed with which the application transmits the packets (i.e., the data rate) and, of course, the energy with which the wireless signal is received. The latter is determined by distance and by the configured output power of the communicating devices. [41] [42] The same references apply to the attached graphs that show measurements of UDP throughput. Each represents an average (UDP) throughput (please note that the error bars are there, but barely visible due to the small variation) of 25 measurements. Each is with a specific packet size (small or large) and with a specific data rate (10\u00a0kbit/s \u2013 100\u00a0Mbit/s). Markers for traffic profiles of common applications are included as well. These figures assume there are no packet errors, which if occurring will lower transmission rate further. Channels and frequencies [ edit ] See also: List of WLAN channels 802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11n-2.4 utilize the 2.400\u20132.500 GHz spectrum, one of the ISM bands . 802.11a and 802.11n use the more heavily regulated 4.915\u20135.825 GHz band. These are commonly referred to as the \"2.4\u00a0GHz and 5\u00a0GHz bands\" in most sales literature. Each spectrum is sub-divided into channels with a center frequency and bandwidth, analogous to the way radio and TV broadcast bands are sub-divided. The 2.4\u00a0GHz band is divided into 14 channels spaced 5\u00a0MHz apart, beginning with channel\u00a01, which is centered on 2.412\u00a0GHz. The latter channels have additional restrictions or are unavailable for use in some regulatory domains. Graphical representation of Wi-Fi channels in the 2.4\u00a0GHz band The channel numbering of the 5.725\u20135.875 GHz spectrum is less intuitive due to the differences in regulations between countries. These are discussed in greater detail on the list of WLAN channels . Channel spacing within the 2.4\u00a0GHz band [ edit ] In addition to specifying the channel center frequency, 802.11 also specifies (in Clause 17) a spectral mask defining the permitted power distribution across each channel. The mask requires the signal be attenuated a minimum of 20 dB from its peak amplitude at \u00b111\u00a0MHz from the centre frequency, the point at which a channel is effectively 22\u00a0MHz wide. One consequence is that stations can use only every fourth or fifth channel without overlap. Availability of channels is regulated by country, constrained in part by how each country allocates radio spectrum to various services. At one extreme, Japan permits the use of all 14 channels for 802.11b, and 1\u201313 for 802.11g/n-2.4. Other countries such as Spain initially allowed only channels 10 and 11, and France allowed only 10, 11, 12, and 13; however, they now allow channels 1 through 13. [43] [44] North America and some Central and South American countries allow only 1 through 11. Spectral masks for 802.11g channels 1\u201314 in the 2.4\u00a0GHz band Since the spectral mask defines only power output restrictions up to \u00b111\u00a0MHz from the center frequency to be attenuated by \u221250\u00a0dBr, it is often assumed that the energy of the channel extends no further than these limits. It is more correct to say that, given the separation between channels, the overlapping signal on any channel should be sufficiently attenuated to minimally interfere with a transmitter on any other channel. Due to the near-far problem a transmitter can impact (desense) a receiver on a \"non-overlapping\" channel, but only if it is close to the victim receiver (within a meter) or operating above allowed power levels. Confusion often arises over the amount of channel separation required between transmitting devices. 802.11b was based on DSSS modulation and utilized a channel bandwidth of 22\u00a0MHz, resulting in three \"non-overlapping\" channels (1, 6, and 11). 802.11g was based on OFDM modulation and utilized a channel bandwidth of 20\u00a0MHz. This occasionally leads to the belief that four \"non-overlapping\" channels (1, 5, 9, and 13) exist under 802.11g, although this is not the case as per 17.4.6.3 Channel Numbering of operating channels of the IEEE Std 802.11 (2012), which states \"In a multiple cell network topology, overlapping and/or adjacent cells using different channels can operate simultaneously without interference if the distance between the center frequencies is at least 25\u00a0MHz.\" [45] and section 18.3.9.3 and Figure 18-13. This does not mean that the technical overlap of the channels recommends the non-use of overlapping channels. The amount of interference seen on a configuration using channels 1, 5, 9, and 13 can have very small difference from a three-channel configuration, [46] and in the paper entitled \"Effect of adjacent-channel interference in IEEE 802.11 WLANs\" by Villegas this is also demonstrated. [47] 802.11 non-overlapping channels for 2.4GHz. Covers 802.11b,g,n Although the statement that channels 1, 5, 9, and 13 are \"non-overlapping\" is limited to spacing or product density, the concept has some merit in limited circumstances. Special care must be taken to adequately space AP cells, since overlap between the channels may cause unacceptable degradation of signal quality and throughput. [48] If more advanced equipment such as spectral analyzers are available, overlapping channels may be used under certain circumstances. This way, more channels are available. [47] Regulatory domains and legal compliance [ edit ] IEEE uses the phrase regdomain to refer to a legal regulatory region. Different countries define different levels of allowable transmitter power, time that a channel can be occupied, and different available channels. [49] Domain codes are specified for the United States, Canada , ETSI (Europe) , Spain , France , Japan , and China . Most Wi-Fi certified devices default to regdomain 0, which means least common denominator settings, i.e., the device will not transmit at a power above the allowable power in any nation, nor will it use frequencies that are not permitted in any nation. [ citation needed ] The regdomain setting is often made difficult or impossible to change so that the end users do not conflict with local regulatory agencies such as the United States ' Federal Communications Commission . Layer 2 \u2013 Datagrams [ edit ] The datagrams are called frames . Current 802.11 standards specify frame types for use in transmission of data as well as management and control of wireless links. Frames are divided into very specific and standardized sections. Each frame consists of a MAC header , payload , and frame check sequence (FCS). Some frames may not have a payload. The first two bytes of the MAC header form a frame control field specifying the form and function of the frame. This frame control field is subdivided into the following sub-fields: Protocol Version: Two bits representing the protocol version. Currently used protocol version is zero. Other values are reserved for future use. Type: Two bits identifying the type of WLAN frame. Control, Data, and Management are various frame types defined in IEEE 802.11. Subtype: Four bits providing additional discrimination between frames. Type and Subtype are used together to identify the exact frame. ToDS and FromDS: Each is one bit in size. They indicate whether a data frame is headed for a distribution system. Control and management frames set these values to zero. All the data frames will have one of these bits set. However communication within an Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS) network always set these bits to zero. More Fragments: The More Fragments bit is set when a packet is divided into multiple frames for transmission. Every frame except the last frame of a packet will have this bit set. Retry: Sometimes frames require retransmission, and for this there is a Retry bit that is set to one when a frame is resent. This aids in the elimination of duplicate frames. Power Management: This bit indicates the power management state of the sender after the completion of a frame exchange. Access points are required to manage the connection, and will never set the power-saver bit. More Data: The More Data bit is used to buffer frames received in a distributed system. The access point uses this bit to facilitate stations in power-saver mode. It indicates that at least one frame is available, and addresses all stations connected. Protected Frame: The Protected Frame bit is set to one if the frame body is encrypted by a protection mechanism such as Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA), or Wi-FI Protected Access II (WPA2). Order: This bit is set only when the \"strict ordering\" delivery method is employed. Frames and fragments are not always sent in order as it causes a transmission performance penalty. The next two bytes are reserved for the Duration ID field. This field can take one of three forms: Duration, Contention-Free Period (CFP), and Association ID (AID). An 802.11 frame can have up to four address fields. Each field can carry a MAC address . Address 1 is the receiver, Address 2 is the transmitter, Address 3 is used for filtering purposes by the receiver. [ dubious \u2013 discuss ] The remaining fields of the header are: The Sequence Control field is a two-byte section used for identifying message order as well as eliminating duplicate frames. The first 4 bits are used for the fragmentation number, and the last 12 bits are the sequence number. An optional two-byte Quality of Service control field that was added with 802.11e . The payload or frame body field is variable in size, from 0 to 2304 bytes plus any overhead from security encapsulation, and contains information from higher layers. The Frame Check Sequence (FCS) is the last four bytes in the standard 802.11 frame. Often referred to as the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC), it allows for integrity check of retrieved frames. As frames are about to be sent, the FCS is calculated and appended. When a station receives a frame, it can calculate the FCS of the frame and compare it to the one received. If they match, it is assumed that the frame was not distorted during transmission. [50] Management frames [ edit ] Management frames allow for the maintenance of communication. Some common 802.11 subtypes include: Authentication frame: 802.11 authentication begins with the Wireless network interface card (WNIC) sending an authentication frame to the access point containing its identity. With an open system authentication, the WNIC sends only a single authentication frame, and the access point responds with an authentication frame of its own indicating acceptance or rejection. With shared key authentication, after the WNIC sends its initial authentication request it will receive an authentication frame from the access point containing challenge text. The WNIC sends an authentication frame containing the encrypted version of the challenge text to the access point. The access point ensures the text was encrypted with the correct key by decrypting it with its own key. The result of this process determines the WNIC's authentication status. Association request frame: Sent from a station it enables the access point to allocate resources and synchronize. The frame carries information about the WNIC, including supported data rates and the SSID of the network the station wishes to associate with. If the request is accepted, the access point reserves memory and establishes an association ID for the WNIC. Association response frame: Sent from an access point to a station containing the acceptance or rejection to an association request. If it is an acceptance, the frame will contain information such an association ID and supported data rates. Beacon frame : Sent periodically from an access point to announce its presence and provide the SSID , and other parameters for WNICs within range. Deauthentication frame : Sent from a station wishing to terminate connection from another station. Disassociation frame: Sent from a station wishing to terminate connection. It's an elegant way to allow the access point to relinquish memory allocation and remove the WNIC from the association table. Probe request frame: Sent from a station when it requires information from another station. Probe response frame: Sent from an access point containing capability information, supported data rates, etc., after receiving a probe request frame. Reassociation request frame: A WNIC sends a reassociation request when it drops from range of the currently associated access point and finds another access point with a stronger signal. The new access point coordinates the forwarding of any information that may still be contained in the buffer of the previous access point. Reassociation response frame: Sent from an access point containing the acceptance or rejection to a WNIC reassociation request frame. The frame includes information required for association such as the association ID and supported data rates. Information Elements [ edit ] 2. In terms of ICT , an Information Element (IE) is a part of management frames in the IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN protocol. IEs are a device's way to transfer descriptive information about itself inside management frames. There are usually several IEs inside each such frame, and each is built of TLVs mostly defined outside the basic IEEE 802.11 specification. The common structure of an IE is as follows: \u2190 1 \u2192  \u2190 1 \u2192   \u2190       3       \u2192   \u2190  1-252  \u2192\n------------------------------------------------\n| Type |Length|        OUI        |    Data    |\n------------------------------------------------ Whereas the OUI ( organizationally unique identifier ) is used only when necessary to the protocol being used, and the data field holds the TLVs relevant to that IE. Control frames [ edit ] Control frames facilitate in the exchange of data frames between stations. Some common 802.11 control frames include: Acknowledgement (ACK) frame: After receiving a data frame, the receiving station will send an ACK frame to the sending station if no errors are found. If the sending station doesn't receive an ACK frame within a predetermined period of time, the sending station will resend the frame. Request to Send (RTS) frame: The RTS and CTS frames provide an optional collision reduction scheme for access points with hidden stations. A station sends a RTS frame as the first step in a two-way handshake required before sending data frames. Clear to Send (CTS) frame: A station responds to an RTS frame with a CTS frame. It provides clearance for the requesting station to send a data frame. The CTS provides collision control management by including a time value for which all other stations are to hold off transmission while the requesting station transmits. Data frames [ edit ] Data frames carry packets from web pages, files, etc. within the body. [51] The body begins with an IEEE 802.2 header, with the Destination Service Access Point (DSAP) specifying the protocol; however, if the DSAP is hex AA, the 802.2 header is followed by a Subnetwork Access Protocol (SNAP) header, with the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) and protocol ID (PID) fields specifying the protocol. If the OUI is all zeroes, the protocol ID field is an EtherType value. [52] Almost all 802.11 data frames use 802.2 and SNAP headers, and most use an OUI of 00:00:00 and an EtherType value. Similar to TCP congestion control on the internet, frame loss is built into the operation of 802.11. To select the correct transmission speed or Modulation and Coding Scheme , a rate control algorithm may test different speeds. The actual packet loss rate of an Access points vary widely for different link conditions. There are variations in the loss rate experienced on production Access points, between 10% and 80%, with 30% being a common average. [53] It is important to be aware that the link layer should recover these lost frames. If the sender does not receive an Acknowledgement (ACK) frame, then it will be resent. Standards and amendments [ edit ] Within the IEEE 802.11 Working Group, [31] the following IEEE Standards Association Standard and Amendments exist: IEEE 802.11-1997 : The WLAN standard was originally 1\u00a0Mbit/s and 2\u00a0Mbit/s, 2.4\u00a0GHz RF and infrared (IR) standard (1997), all the others listed below are Amendments to this standard, except for Recommended Practices 802.11F and 802.11T.

Standard vs. amendment [ edit ] Both the terms \"standard\" and \"amendment\" are used when referring to the different variants of IEEE standards. [56] As far as the IEEE Standards Association is concerned, there is only one current standard; it is denoted by IEEE 802.11 followed by the date that it was published. IEEE 802.11-2016 is the only version currently in publication, superseding previous releases. The standard is updated by means of amendments. Amendments are created by task groups (TG). Both the task group and their finished document are denoted by 802.11 followed by a non-capitalized letter, for example, IEEE 802.11a and IEEE 802.11b . Updating 802.11 is the responsibility of task group m. In order to create a new version, TGm combines the previous version of the standard and all published amendments. TGm also provides clarification and interpretation to industry on published documents. New versions of the IEEE 802.11 were published in 1999, 2007, 2012, and 2016. [57] Nomenclature [ edit ] Various terms in 802.11 are used to specify aspects of wireless local-area networking operation, and may be unfamiliar to some readers. For example, Time Unit (usually abbreviated TU) is used to indicate a unit of time equal to 1024 microseconds. Numerous time constants are defined in terms of TU (rather than the nearly equal millisecond). Also the term \"Portal\" is used to describe an entity that is similar to an 802.1H bridge. A Portal provides access to the WLAN by non-802.11 LAN STAs. Community networks [ edit ] With the proliferation of cable modems and DSL , there is an ever-increasing market of people who wish to establish small networks in their homes to share their broadband Internet connection. Many hotspot or free networks frequently allow anyone within range, including passersby outside, to connect to the Internet. There are also efforts by volunteer groups to establish wireless community networks to provide free wireless connectivity to the public. Security [ edit ] In 2001, a group from the University of California, Berkeley presented a paper describing weaknesses in the 802.11 Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) security mechanism defined in the original standard; they were followed by Fluhrer, Mantin, and Shamir 's paper titled \"Weaknesses in the Key Scheduling Algorithm of RC4 \". Not long after, Adam Stubblefield and AT&T publicly announced the first verification of the attack. In the attack, they were able to intercept transmissions and gain unauthorized access to wireless networks. The IEEE set up a dedicated task group to create a replacement security solution, 802.11i (previously this work was handled as part of a broader 802.11e effort to enhance the MAC layer). The Wi-Fi Alliance announced an interim specification called Wi-Fi Protected Access ( WPA ) based on a subset of the then current IEEE 802.11i draft. These started to appear in products in mid-2003. IEEE 802.11i (also known as WPA2 ) itself was ratified in June 2004, and uses the Advanced Encryption Standard AES, instead of RC4 , which was used in WEP. The modern recommended encryption for the home/consumer space is WPA2 (AES Pre-Shared Key), and for the enterprise space is WPA2 along with a RADIUS authentication server (or another type of authentication server) and a strong authentication method such as EAP-TLS . In January 2005, the IEEE set up yet another task group \"w\" to protect management and broadcast frames, which previously were sent unsecured. Its standard was published in 2009. [58] In December 2011, a security flaw was revealed that affects some wireless routers with a specific implementation of the optional Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) feature. While WPS is not a part of 802.11, the flaw allows an attacker within the range of the wireless router to recover the WPS PIN and, with it, the router's 802.11i password in a few hours. [59] [60] In late 2014, Apple announced that its iOS 8 mobile operating system would scramble MAC addresses [61] during the pre-association stage to thwart retail footfall tracking made possible by the regular transmission of uniquely identifiable probe requests. Non-standard 802.11 extensions and equipment [ edit ] Main article: 802.11 non-standard equipment Many companies implement wireless networking equipment with non-IEEE standard 802.11 extensions either by implementing proprietary or draft features. These changes may lead to incompatibilities between these extensions.

{"question": "use partial charges to indicate all polar bonds in the following molecules", "answer": "", "context": "Partial charge - Wikipedia Partial charge From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search A partial charge is a non-integer charge value when measured in elementary charge units. Partial charge is more commonly called net atomic charge. It is represented by the Greek lowercase letter \u03b4 , namely \u03b4\u2212 or \u03b4+. Partial charges are created due to the asymmetric distribution of electrons in chemical bonds. For example, in a polar covalent bond like HCl, the shared electron oscillates between the bonded atoms. The resulting partial charges are a property only of zones within the distribution, and not the assemblage as a whole. For example, chemists often choose to look at a small space surrounding the nucleus of an atom : When an electrically neutral atom bonds chemically to another neutral atom that is more electronegative , its electrons are partially drawn away. This leaves the region about that atom's nucleus with a partial positive charge, and it creates a partial negative charge on the atom to which it is bonded.

In such a situation, the distributed charges taken as a group always carries a whole number of elementary charge units. Yet one can point to zones within the assemblage where less than a full charge resides, such as the area around an atom's nucleus. This is possible in part because particles are not like mathematical points\u2014which must be either inside a zone or outside it\u2014but are smeared out by the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics . Because of this smearing effect, if one defines a sufficiently small zone, a fundamental particle may be both partly inside and partly outside it. Uses [ edit ] Partial atomic charges are used in molecular mechanics force fields to compute the electrostatic interaction energy using Coulomb's law . They are also often used for a qualitative understanding of the structure and reactivity of molecules. Determining partial atomic charges [ edit ] Partial atomic charges can be used to quantify the degree of ionic versus covalent bonding of any compound across the periodic table. The necessity for such quantities arises, for example, in molecular simulations to compute bulk and surface properties in agreement with experiment. Evidence for chemically different compounds shows that available experimental data and chemical understanding lead to justified atomic charges. [1] Atomic charges for a given compound can be derived in multiple ways, such as: extracted from electron densities measured using high resolution x-ray, gamma ray, or electron beam diffraction experiments measured dipole moments the Extended Born thermodynamic cycle, including an analysis of covalent and ionic bonding contributions spectroscopically measured properties, such as core-electron binding energy shifts the relationship of atomic charges to melting points, solubility, and cleavage energies for a set of similar compounds with similar degree of covalent bonding the relationship of atomic charges to chemical reactivity and reaction mechanisms for similar compounds reported in the literature. The discussion of individual compounds in prior work has shown convergence in atomic charges, i.e., a high level of consistency between the assigned degree of polarity and the physical-chemical properties mentioned above. The resulting uncertainty in atomic charges is \u00b10.1e to \u00b10.2e for highly charged compounds, and often <0.1e for compounds with atomic charges below \u00b11.0e. Often, the application of one or two of the above concepts already leads to very good values, especially taking into account a growing library of experimental benchmark compounds and compounds with tested force fields. [2] The published research literature on partial atomic charges varies in quality from extremely poor to extremely well-done. Although a large number of different methods for assigning partial atomic charges from quantum chemistry calculations have been proposed over many decades, the vast majority of proposed methods do not work well across a wide variety of material types. [3] [4] Only as recently as 2016 was a method for theoretically computing partial atomic charges developed that performs consistently well across an extremely wide variety of material types. [3] [4] All of the earlier methods had fundamental deficiencies that prevented them from assigning accurate partial atomic charges in many materials. [3] [4] Mulliken and L\u00f6wdin partial charges are physically unreasonable, because they do not have a mathematical limit as the basis set is improved towards completeness. [5] Hirshfeld partial charges are usually too low in magnitude. [6] Some methods for assigning partial atomic charges do not converge to a unique solution. [3] In some materials, atoms in molecules analysis yields non-nuclear attractors describing electron density partitions that cannot be assigned to any atom in the material; in such cases, atoms in molecules analysis cannot assign partial atomic charges. [7] According to Cramer (2002), partial charge methods can be divided into four classes: [8] Class I charges are those that are not determined from quantum mechanics, but from some intuitive or arbitrary approach. These approaches can be based on experimental data such as dipoles and electronegativities. Class II charges are derived from partitioning the molecular wave function using some arbitrary, orbital based scheme. Class III charges are based on a partitioning of a physical observable derived from the wave function, such as electron density. Class IV charges are derived from a semiempirical mapping of a precursor charge of type II or III to reproduce experimentally determined observables such as dipole moments. The following is a detailed list of methods, partly based on Meister and Schwarz (1994).

Centipedes are elongated metameric creatures with one pair of legs per body segment. Centipedes are known to be highly venomous, and often inject paralyzing venom. Despite the name, centipedes can have a varying number of legs, ranging from 30 to 354. Centipedes always have an odd number of pairs of legs. [1] [2] [3] Therefore, no centipede has exactly 100 legs. A key trait uniting this group is a pair of venom claws or forcipules formed from a modified first appendage . Centipedes are predominantly carnivorous . [4] : 168 Their size can range from a few millimetres in the smaller lithobiomorphs and geophilomorphs to about 30\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) in the largest scolopendromorphs. Centipedes can be found in a wide variety of environments. They normally have a drab coloration combining shades of brown and red. Cavernicolous (cave-dwelling) and subterranean species may lack pigmentation, and many tropical scolopendromorphs have bright aposematic colours. Worldwide, an estimated 8,000 species of centipedes are thought to exist, [5] of which 3,000 have been described . Centipedes have a wide geographical range, where they even reach beyond the Arctic Circle . [4] They are found in an array of terrestrial habitats from tropical rainforests to deserts . Within these habitats, centipedes require a moist microhabitat because they lack the waxy cuticle of insects and arachnids , therefore causing them to rapidly lose water. [6] Accordingly, they are found in soil and leaf litter , under stones and dead wood, and inside logs. Centipedes are among the largest terrestrial invertebrate predators , and often contribute significantly to the invertebrate predatory biomass in terrestrial ecosystems. Only one species, Scolopendra cataracta , is known to be amphibious and is believed to hunt aquatic or amphibious invertebrates.

They have a pair of elongated mandibles , and two pairs of maxillae . The first pair of maxillae form the lower lip, and bear short palps . The first pair of limbs stretch forward from the body to cover the remainder of the mouth. These limbs, or maxillipeds , end in sharp claws and include venom glands that help the animal to kill or paralyze its prey. [6] Many species of centipedes lack eyes, but some possess a variable number of ocelli , which are sometimes clustered together to form true compound eyes . However, these eyes are only capable of discerning light and dark, and have no true vision. In some species, the first pair of legs at the head end of the centipede acts as sense organs similar to antennae, but unlike the antennae of most other animals, theirs point backwards. Unusual sense organs found in some groups are the organs of T\u00f6m\u00f6sv\u00e1ry . These are located at the base of the antennae, and consist of a disc-like structure with a central pore surrounded by sensory cells. They are probably used for sensing vibrations, and may even provide a sense of hearing. [6] Forcipules are a unique feature found only in centipedes and in no other arthropods. The forcipules are modifications of the first pair of legs , forming a pincer -like appendage always found just behind the head. [8] Forcipules are not true mouthparts , although they are used in the capture of prey items, injecting venom and holding onto captured prey. Venom glands run through a tube almost to the tip of each forcipule. [8] Behind the head, the body consists of 15 or more segments. Most of the segments bear a single pair of legs, with the maxillipeds projecting forward from the first body segment, and the final two segments being small and legless. Each pair of legs is slightly longer than the pair immediately in front of it, ensuring that they do not overlap, so reducing the chance that they will collide with each other while moving swiftly. In extreme cases, the last pair of legs may be twice the length of the first pair. The final segment bears a telson and includes the openings of the reproductive organs. [6] As predators, centipedes mainly use their antennae to seek out their prey. The digestive tract forms a simple tube, with digestive glands attached to the mouthparts. Like insects, centipedes breathe through a tracheal system , typically with a single opening, or spiracle on each body segment. They excrete waste through a single pair of malpighian tubules . [6] Scolopendra gigantea , also known as the Amazonian giant centipede, is the largest existing species of centipede in the world, reaching over 30\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) in length. It is known to eat lizards , frogs , birds , mice , and even bats , catching them in midflight, [9] as well as rodents and spiders . Lifecycle [ edit ] A centipede protecting her eggmass Centipede reproduction does not involve copulation. Males deposit a spermatophore for the female to take up. In one clade, this spermatophore is deposited in a web, and the male undertakes a courtship dance to encourage the female to engulf his sperm. In other cases, the males just leave them for the females to find. In temperate areas, egg laying occurs in spring and summer, but in subtropical and tropical areas, little seasonality to centipede breeding is apparent. A few species of parthenogenetic centipedes are known. [4] The Lithobiomorpha and Scutigeromorpha lay their eggs singly in holes in the soil, and the female fills the holes with soil and leaves them. The number of eggs laid ranges from about 10 to 50. Time of development of the embryo to hatching is highly variable and may take from one to a few months. Time of development to reproductive period is highly variable within and among species. For example, it can take 3 years for S. coleoptrata to achieve adulthood, whereas under the right conditions, lithobiomorph species may reach a reproductive period in 1 year. In addition, centipedes are relatively long-lived when compared to insects. For example, the European Lithobius forficatus may live for 5 to 6 years, [10] and the wide-ranging Scolopendra subspinipes can live for over 10 years. [11] The combination of a small number of eggs laid, long gestation period, and long time of development to reproduction has led authors to label lithobiomorph centipedes as K-selected . [12] Females of the Geophilomorpha and Scolopendromorpha show far more parental care. The eggs, 15 to 60 in number, are laid in a nest in the soil or in rotten wood. The female stays with the eggs, guarding and licking them to protect them from fungi . The female in some species stays with the young after they have hatched, guarding them until they are ready to leave. If disturbed, the female either abandons the eggs or eats them; abandoned eggs tend to fall prey to fungi rapidly. Some species of Scolopendromorpha are matriphagic, meaning the offspring eat their mother. Little is known of the life history of the Craterostigmomorpha . Anamorphy vs. epimorphy [ edit ] Centipedes grow their legs at different points in their development. In the primitive condition, exhibited by the Lithobiomorpha, Scutigeromorpha, and Craterostigmomorpha, development is anamorphic : more pairs of legs are grown between moults . For example, Scutigera coleoptrata , the American house centipede, hatches with only four pairs of legs and in successive moults has 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 15, 15 and 15 before becoming a sexually mature adult. Life stages with fewer than 15 pairs of legs are called larval stadia (about five stages). After the full complement of legs is achieved, the now postlarval stadia (about five stages) develop gonopods, sensory pores, more antennal segments, and more ocelli. All mature lithobiomorph centipedes have 15 leg-bearing segments. [4] : 27 The Craterostigmomorpha only have one phase of anamorphosis, with embryos having 12 pairs, and moultees 15. The clade Epimorpha, consisting of the orders Geophilomorpha and Scolopendromorpha, exhibits epimorphy: all pairs of legs are developed in the embryonic stages, and offspring do not develop more legs between moults. This clade contains the longest centipedes; the maximum number of thoracic segments may also vary intraspecifically, often on a geographical basis; in most cases, females bear more legs than males. The number of leg-bearing segments varies widely, from 15 to 191, but the developmental mode of their creation means they are always added in pairs\u2014hence the total number of pairs is always odd. Ecology [ edit ] A centipede ( Scolopendra cingulata ) being eaten by a European roller Centipede seen on vegetation at Agumbe , Karnataka , India Centipedes are predominantly generalist predators, which means they have adapted to eat a variety of different available prey. Examination of centipede gut contents suggests that plant material is an unimportant part of their diets, although centipedes have been observed to eat vegetable matter when starved during laboratory experiments. [4] : 168 Centipedes are mostly nocturnal . Studies on their activity rhythms confirm this, although a few observations of centipedes active during the day have been made, and one species, Strigamia chinophila , is diurnal. What centipedes actually eat is not well known because of their cryptic lifestyles and thorough mastication of food. Laboratory feeding trials support that they will feed as generalists, taking almost anything that is soft-bodied and in a reasonable size range. Earthworms may provide the bulk of diets for geophilomorphs, since they burrow through the soil and earthworm bodies would be easily pierced by their venom claws. Geophilomorphs probably cannot subdue earthworms larger than themselves, so smaller earthworms may be a substantial proportion of their diet. [13] Scolopendromorphs, given their size, are able to feed on vertebrates, in addition to invertebrates. They have been observed eating reptiles, amphibians, small mammals, bats, and birds. Springtails may provide a large proportion of lithobiomorph diets. Little is known about scutigeromorph or craterostigmomorph diets. All centipedes are potential intraguild predators . Centipedes and spiders may frequently prey on one another. [4] Many larger animals prey upon centipedes, such as mongooses , mice , salamanders , beetles and snakes . [4] : 354\u2013356 They form an important item of diet for many species and the staple diet of some such as the African ant Amblyopone pluto , which feeds solely on geophilomorph centipedes, [14] and the South African Cape black-headed snake Aparallactus capensis . [4] : 354\u2013356 Centipede defences include their speed and venomous forcipules, as well as the secretion of defensive chemicals. Geophilomorph centipedes can secrete sticky substances that generate toxic hydrogen cyanide and benzoic acid from microscopic glands on their undersides. Similarly, lithobiomorph centipedes secrete a sticky substance from glands in the rear-most two pairs of legs. [15] Water regulation is an important aspect of centipede ecology, since they lose water rapidly in dry conditions and are found in moist microhabitats . Water loss is a result of centipedes lacking a waxy covering of their exoskeleton and excreting waste nitrogen as ammonia , which requires extra water. Centipedes deal with water loss through a variety of adaptations. Geophilomorphs lose water less rapidly than lithobiomorphs, though they have a greater surface area to volume ratio. This may be because geophilomorphs have a more heavily sclerotized pleural membrane. Spiracle shape, size, and ability to constrict also have an influence on rate of water loss. In addition, the number and size of coxal pores may be variables affecting centipede water balance. Centipedes live in many different habitat types\u2014forest, savannah , prairie, and desert, to name a few. Some geophilomorphs are adapted to littoral habitats, where they feed on barnacles . [16] Species of all orders excluding the Craterostigmomorpha have adapted to caves. Centipede densities have been recorded as high as 600/m 2 and biomass as high as 500\u00a0mg/m 2 wet weight. Small geophilomorphs attain highest densities, followed by small lithobiomorphs. Large lithobiomorphs attain densities of 20/m 2 . One study of scolopendromorphs records Scolopendra morsitans in a Nigerian savannah at a density of 0.16/m 2 and a biomass of 140\u00a0mg/m 2 wet weight. [17] Uses [ edit ] Centipedes at Wangfujing market Although unusual in most cultures as a food item, certain large-sized centipedes are consumed in China , usually skewered and grilled or deep fried. They are often seen in street vendor's stalls in large cities, including Donghuamen and Wangfujing markets in Beijing . [18] [19] Also in China, as well as in Laos , Thailand , and Cambodia , large centipedes are kept in liquor for a period of time. This custom is allegedly part of the traditional Chinese medicine . Said to have medicinal properties and to be reinvigorating, [20] the liquor with the centipede submerged in it is consumed as a special drink. [21] Hazards to humans [ edit ] Main article: Centipede bite Some species of centipedes can be hazardous to humans because of their bite. Although a bite to an adult human is usually very painful and may cause severe swelling, chills, fever , and weakness, it is unlikely to be fatal. Bites can be dangerous to small children and those with allergies to bee stings. The venomous bite of larger centipedes can induce anaphylactic shock in such people. Smaller centipedes are generally incapable of piercing human skin. [22] Even nonvenomous centipedes are considered frightening by humans due to their dozens of legs moving at the same time and their tendency to dart swiftly out of the darkness towards one's feet. [23] A 19th-century Tibetan poet warned his fellow Buddhists, \"if you enjoy frightening others, you will be reborn as a centipede.\" [24] Evolution [ edit ] Internal phylogeny of the Chilopoda Scutigeromorpha Pleurostigmophora Lithobiomorpha Phylactometria Craterostigmomorpha Epimorpha Scolopendromorpha Geophilomorpha The upper three groups form the paraphyletic Anamorpha . The fossil record of centipedes extends back to 430 million years ago , during the Late Silurian . [25] They belong to the subphylum Myriapoda which includes Diplopoda , Symphyla , and Pauropoda . The oldest known fossil land animal, Pneumodesmus newmani , is a myriapod . Being among the earliest terrestrial animals, centipedes were one of the first to fill a fundamental niche as ground level generalist predators in detrital food webs . Today, centipedes are abundant and exist in many harsh habitats. Within the myriapods, centipedes are believed to be the first of the extant classes to branch from the last common ancestor . The five orders of centipedes are: Craterostigmomorpha , Geophilomorpha , Lithobiomorpha , Scolopendromorpha , and Scutigeromorpha . These orders are united into the clade Chilopoda by the following synapomorphies : [26] The first postcephalic appendage is modified to venom claws. The embryonic cuticle on second maxilliped has an egg tooth. The trochanter\u2013prefemur joint is fixed. A spiral ridge occurs on the nucleus of the spermatozoon. The Chilopoda are then split into two clades: the Notostigmophora including the Scutigeromorpha and the Pleurostigmophora including the other four orders. The main difference is that the Notostigmomorpha have their spiracles located mid-dorsally. It was previously believed that Chilopoda was split into Anamorpha (Lithobiomorpha and Scutigeromorpha) and Epimorpha (Geophilomorpha and Scolopendromorpha), based on developmental modes, with the relationship of the Craterostigmomorpha being uncertain. Recent phylogenetic analyses using combined molecular and morphological characters supports the previous phylogeny. [26] The Epimorpha still exist as a monophyletic group within the Pleurostigmophora, but the Anamorpha are paraphyletic . Geophilomorph centipedes have been used to argue for the developmental constraint of evolution; that the evolvability of a trait, the number of segments in the case of geophilomorph centipedes, was constrained by the mode of development. The geophilomorph centipedes have variable segment numbers within species, yet as with all centipedes, they always have an odd number of pairs of legs. In this taxon, the number of segments ranges from 27 to 191, but is never an even number. [27] Orders and families [ edit ] Representatives of centipede orders Scutigera coleoptrata (Scutigeromorpha: Scutigeridae) Lithobius forficatus (Lithobiomorpha: Lithobiidae) Geophilus flavus (Geophilomorpha: Geophilidae) Scolopendra cataracta (Scolopendromorpha: Scolopendridae) Scutigeromorpha [ edit ] The Scutigeromorpha are anamorphic, reaching 15 leg-bearing segments in length. Also known as house centipedes, they are very fast creatures, and able to withstand falling at great speed: they reach up to 15 body lengths per second when dropped, surviving the fall. They are the only centipede group to retain their original compound eyes , within which a crystalline layer analogous to that seen in chelicerates and insects can be observed. They also bear long and multi-segmented antennae. Adaptation to a burrowing lifestyle has led to the degeneration of compound eyes in other orders; this feature is of great use in phylogenetic analysis. The group is the sole extant representative of the Notostigmomorpha , defined by having a single spiracle opening at the posterior of each dorsal plate. The more derived groups bear a plurality of spiracular openings on their sides, and are termed the Pleurostigmomorpha . Some even have several unpaired spiracles that can be found along the mid-dorsal line and closer to their posterior section of tergites . There are three families: Psellioididae , Scutigeridae and Scutigerinidae . Pselliodidae includes just a few species in the genus Sphendononema (= Pselliodes ), occurring in the Neotropics and tropical Africa. Scutigerinidae, composed of three species in the genus Scutigerina , is restricted to southern Africa and Madagascar. Most scutigeromorphs from other parts of the world belong to the Scutigeridae, which includes two subfamilies, the Scutigerinae and Thereuoneminae. Lithobiomorpha [ edit ] The Lithobiomorpha, also known as stone centipedes, represent the other main group of anamorphic centipedes; they also reach a mature segment count of 15 trunk segments. This group has lost the compound eyes, and sometimes has no eyes altogether. Instead, its eyes have a single ocellus or a group of ocelli. Its spiracles are paired and can be found laterally. Every leg-bearing segment of this organism has a separate tergite, these alternating in length apart from a pair of long tergites on each of segments 7 and 8. It also has relatively short antennae and legs compared to the Scutigeromorpha. Two families are included, the Henicopidae and Lithobiidae . Craterostigmomorpha [ edit ] The Craterostigmomorpha are the least diverse centipede clade, comprising only two extant species, both in the genus Craterostigmus . [28] Their geographic range is restricted to Tasmania and New Zealand. They have a distinct body plan; their anamorphosis comprises a single stage: in their first moult, they grow from having 12 segments to having 15. Their low diversity and intermediate position between the primitive anamorphic centipedes and the derived Epimorpha has led to them being likened to the platypus . [28] They represent the survivors of a once diverse clade. Maternal brooding unites the Craterostigomomorpha with the Epimorpha into the clade Phylactometria . This trait is thought to be closely linked with the presence of sternal pores, which secrete sticky or noxious secretions, which mainly serve to repel predators and parasites . The presence of these pores on the Devonian Devonobius permits its inclusion in this clade, allowing its divergence to be dated to 375 (or more) million years ago . [29] Scolopendromorpha [ edit ] The Scolopendromorpha, also known as tropical centipedes, possess 21 or 23 body segments (apart from a single species, Scolopendropsis duplicata , which has 39 or 43 segments) with the same number of paired legs. Their antennae have 17 or more segments. The eyes have a fixed number of four ocelli on each side in the family Scolopendridae and one ocellus per side in the genus Mimops (family Mimopidae), but other families are blind. The order comprises the five families Cryptopidae , Scolopendridae , Mimopidae, Scolopocryptopidae , and Plutoniumidae. The only known amphibious centipede, Scolopendra cataracta , belongs to this order. [7] [30] [31] Geophilomorpha [ edit ] The Geophilomorpha, commonly known as soil centipedes, bear upwards of 27 leg-bearing segments. They are eyeless and blind, and bear spiracles on all leg-bearing segments\u2014in contrast to other groups, which usually bear them only on their 3rd, 5th, 8th, 10th, 12th, and 14th segments\u2014a \"mid-body break\", accompanied by a change in tagmatic shape, occurring roughly at the interchange from odd to even segments. This group, the most diverse at 1260 species, also contains the largest and leggiest specimens at 27 or more pairs of legs. They also have 14\u2013segmented antennae. The group includes at least seven families: Mecistocephalidae , Geophilidae (including the former Linotaeniidae , Dignathodontidae and Macronicophilidae), Oryidae , Himantariidae, Schendylidae (including the former Ballophilidae), Zelanophilidae, and Gonibregmatidae (including the former Neogeophilidae and Eriphantidae).

{"question": "where are the summer olympics held this year", "answer": "", "context": "List of Olympic Games host cities - Wikipedia List of Olympic Games host cities From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search This is a list of host cities of the Olympic Games, both summer and winter, since the modern Olympics began in 1896. Since then, summer games have usually\u00a0\u2013  but not always\u00a0\u2013  celebrated a four-year period known as an Olympiad. There have been 28 Summer Olympic Games held in 23 cities, and 23 Winter Olympic Games held in 20 cities. In addition, three summer and two winter editions of the Games were scheduled to take place but later cancelled due to war: Berlin (summer) in 1916; Tokyo / Helsinki (summer) and Sapporo / Garmisch-Partenkirchen (winter) in 1940; and London (summer) and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy (winter) in 1944. The 1906 Summer Olympics were officially sanctioned and held in Athens . However, in 1949, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), decided to unrecognize the 1906 Games. [1] Four cities have been chosen by the IOC to host upcoming Olympic Games: Tokyo for the 2020 Summer Olympics , Beijing for the 2022 Winter Olympics , Paris for the 2024 Summer Olympics , and Los Angeles for the 2028 Summer Olympics . In 2022, Beijing will become the only city that has held both the summer and the winter Olympic Games. Nine cities will have hosted the Olympic Games more than once: Athens ( 1896 and 2004 Summer Olympics ), Paris ( 1900 , 1924 and 2024 Summer Olympics ), London ( 1908 , 1948 and 2012 Summer Olympics ), St. Moritz ( 1928 and 1948 Winter Olympics ), Lake Placid ( 1932 and 1980 Winter Olympics ), Los Angeles ( 1932 , 1984 and 2028 Summer Olympics ), Innsbruck ( 1964 and 1976 Winter Olympics ), Tokyo ( 1964 and 2020 Summer Olympics ) and Beijing ( 2008 Summer Olympics and 2022 Winter Olympics ). In addition, Stockholm hosted the 1912 Summer Olympics and the equestrian portion of the 1956 Summer Olympics . [d] London became the first city to have hosted three Games with the 2012 Summer Olympics. Paris will become the second city to do this with the 2024 Summer Olympics, followed by Los Angeles as the third in 2028. The United States has hosted a total of eight Olympic Games, more than any other country, followed by France with five editions. Canada , Germany , Italy , Japan , and the United Kingdom have each hosted three Games. The Games have primarily been hosted in the continents of Europe (36 editions) and North America (12 editions); eight Games have been hosted in Asia and two have been hosted in Oceania . In 2016, Rio de Janeiro became South America 's first Olympic host city, while the African continent has yet to hold the Games. Other major geographic regions which have never hosted the Olympics include the Middle East , the Indian subcontinent , the Caribbean , and Southeast Asia . Host cities are selected by the IOC membership, usually seven years in advance. [2] The selection process lasts approximately two years. In the first stage, any city in the world may submit an application to become a host city. After 10 months, the Executive Board of the IOC decides which applicant city will become official candidates as based on the recommendation of a working group that reviews the applications. In a second stage, the candidate cities are investigated thoroughly by an Evaluation Commission, which then submits a final short list of cities to be considered for selection. The host city is then chosen by vote of the IOC session , a general meeting of IOC members.

It is one of the longest Mediterranean coastlines in North Africa . The city of Alexandria lies at the center of Egypt's Mediterranean coastline in Lower Egypt (northern Egypt), as chosen by Alexander the Great in the 4th century BCE. The north coast has been the hub of sea travel between the Mediterranean Sea and the Nile Delta for over 2,300 years. Contents [ hide ] 1 Geography and nature 1.1 Climate 2 Cities, towns and villages 3 See also 4 External links Geography and nature [ edit ] On contrast to Egypt's Red Sea Riviera , its Mediterranean coastline is totally plain with low altitude shrublands along the region, except for the westernmost portion which is formed by the 400m-high Marmarika Plateau . It is also characterised by the occurrence of Egypt's five northernmost lakes. The region has typical Mediterranean flora and fauna on land and in marine life with the weather being between pleasant and hot during summer and mild in winter . The region receives the most rain in Egypt , hail and sleet fall rarely in winter. Snowfalls occur in some inland towns and locations. Climate [ edit ] See also: Climate of Egypt Even though most of Egypt lies within the hot desert climate (BWh) according to K\u00f6ppen climate classification with little precipitation , prevailing winds from the Mediterranean sea greatly moderate the temperatures of the northern coastal line, making the summers moderately hot and humid, while the winters moderately wet and mild, when sleet and hail are also common, in and around the wettest places, as Alexandria . Temperatures range between a minimum monthly average of 9.5\u00a0\u00b0C (49.1\u00a0\u00b0F) in winter and 23\u00a0\u00b0C (73\u00a0\u00b0F) in summer , while a maximum monthly average of 17\u00a0\u00b0C (63\u00a0\u00b0F) in winter and 31\u00a0\u00b0C (88\u00a0\u00b0F) in summer. Cities, towns and villages [ edit ] Egypt's Mediterranean coast can be differentiated into 4 subregions: Western North Coast: Which has higher rain precipitation. Higher altitude witnesses higher snowfalls and it is colder than the other 3 portions. It also has more shrubed and forested terrain, Yet with no lakes. This subregion faces Greece and Crete . It has cities, towns and villages like: Sallum a border town at Libyan borders. Baqiqi a fishing local village. Sidi Barrani a snowy town, and Egypt's closest inhabited settlement towards Europe and Greece . Shammas a fishing local village. Zawyet Umm El Rakham a village with archeological sites. Marsa Matruh the main seaport on Egypt's Western Mediterranean coast. Fuka a village famous for excellent Mediterranean fruits and touristic beaches. El Dabaa a main town. Sidi Abdel Rahman a new touristic seaport town with a number of leading resorts like Hacienda bay and white, Marassi (made by Emaar), Lazorde and Diplo. Central North Coast: The southernmost Mediterranean shoreline in Egypt, forming a big gulf. It has no lakes as well. This subregion faces the West of Turkey . It has cities, towns and villages like: El Alamein the southernmost Mediterranean coastal city Marina, Egypt a leading Egyptian major resorts town, and host site of Ancient Egyptian and Roman monuments. Sidi Kreir a major town and municipality Borg El Arab a major city Alexandria the main Mediterranean city and seaport. At the center of the entire Medi coastline and the second largest city in Egypt . Delta's North Coast: Which is settled by larger populations and hosts larger cities -With exception of Alexandria-. It has Nile Delta which features hail and sleet in winters. Sometime frost and frozen ground during winter nights destroy the crops and agriculture plants. 3 of Egypt's Northern Lakes are located there: Lake Mariout , Edko Lake and Lake Burullus . This subregion faces Central Turkey . Its cities, towns and villages are like: Rosetta a historic western Nile delta city where Rashid's Nile branch and Mediterranean meet (aka Rashid) Baltim at the northern tip of the Nile Delta . One of North Africa 's northern towns Gamasa a local touristic city Ras El Bar a touristic city for locals where Damietta's Nile branch and Mediterranean meet Ezbet El Borg is a fishing city at the other bank of the Damietta River Damietta a major eastern Nile Delta city and seaport in Egypt Eastern North Coast: It has the least precipitation, yet its cities and towns are of great geopolitical and economic importance. It is colder on its eastern part than its other part. 2 Northern lakes of Egypt are found in this subregion as well: Lake Manzala and Lake Bardawil . This subregion faces Cyprus and Turkey . It has cities, towns and villages like: Port Said a European styled-city, entrance to Suez Canal and Egypt's major eastern seaport Arish major east seaport on Arish river and Arish valley Rafah Egypt's last eastern Mediterranean city on the borders with Gaza Strip.

{"question": "a good that can be used in place of another good", "answer": "", "context": "Substitute good - Wikipedia Substitute good From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search This article includes a list of references , but its sources remain unclear because it has insufficient inline citations . Please help to improve this article by introducing more precise citations. (February 2015) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) If the price of Y increases then demand of X increases A substitute good is one good that can be used instead of another. In consumer theory , substitute goods or substitutes are products that a consumer perceives as similar or comparable, so that having more of one product makes them desire less of the other product. Formally, X and Y are substitutes if, when the price of X rises, the demand for Y rises. Potatoes from different farms are an example: if the price of one farm's potatoes goes up, then it can be presumed that fewer people will buy potatoes from that farm and source them from another farm instead. There are different degrees of substitutability. For example, a car and a bicycle may substitute to some extent: if the price of motor fuel increases considerably, one may expect that some people will switch to bicycles. Contents [ hide ] 1 Introduction 2 Increase in price 3 Different types 3.1 Substitutability 3.2 Categorization 4 Substitutability of a good 5 Monopolistic competition 6 Perfect competition 7 Types of substitute goods 8 See also 9 References Introduction [ edit ] In economics, one way that two or more goods can be classified is by examining the relationship of the demand schedules when the price of one good changes. This relationship between demand schedules leads to classification of goods as either substitutes or complements. Substitute goods are goods which, as a result of changed conditions, may replace each other in use (or consumption). [1] A substitute good , in contrast to a complementary good , is a good with a positive cross elasticity of demand . This means a good's demand is increased when the price of another good is increased; both in the same direction. [2] Conversely, the demand for a good is decreased when the price of another good is decreased. If goods A and B are substitutes, an increase in the price of A will result in a leftward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve for B to shift out . A decrease in the price of A will result in a rightward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve for B to shift in . Substitute good graphical example Examples of substitute goods include margarine and butter , tea and coffee , beer and wine. Substitute goods not only occur on the consumer side of the market but also the producer side. Substitutable producer goods would include: petroleum and natural gas (used for heating or electricity ). The degree to which a good has a perfect substitute depends on how specifically the good is defined. Take for example, the demand for Rice Krispies cereal, which is a very narrowly defined good as compared to the demand for cereal generally. The fact that one good is substitutable for another has immediate economic consequences: insofar as one good can be substituted for another, the demands for the two kinds of good will be interrelated by the fact that customers can trade off one good for the other if it becomes advantageous to do so. Increase in price [ edit ] An increase in price ( ceteris paribus ) will result in an increase in demand for its substitute goods. If two goods have a high substitutability, the change in demand will be much greater. Thus, economists can predict that a spike in the cost of a particular brand of detergent is likely to result in a large change in demand for other brands, whereas a change in the price of pencils will have a much smaller effect on the demand for other stationery, such as pens on legal documents or pencils on most high-school maths homework. Different types [ edit ] Substitutability [ edit ] It is important to note that when speaking about substitute goods one is referring to two different kinds of goods; so the \"substitutability\" of one good for another is always a matter of degree. One good is a perfect substitute for another only if it can be used in exactly the same way. In that case the utility of a combination is an increasing function of the sum of the two amounts, and theoretically, in the case of a price difference, there would be no demand for the more expensive good. In microeconomics, two types of substitutes are being distinguished, gross substitutes and net substitutes . Good X i {\\displaystyle X_{i}} is said to be gross substitute of good Y {\\displaystyle Y} if \u2202 X i \u2202 P Y > 0 {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\partial X_{i}}{\\partial P_{Y}}}>0} Goods X and Y are said to be net substitutes if \u2202 X i \u2202 P Y | U = c o n s t > 0 {\\displaystyle \\left.{\\frac {\\partial X_{i}}{\\partial P_{Y}}}\\right|_{U=const}>0} where U = U ( X , Y ) {\\displaystyle U=U(X,Y)} is a utility function for the two goods. [1] Categorization [ edit ] Substitutes differ with respect to their category membership . Within-category substitutes are goods that are members of the same taxonomic category, goods sharing common attributes (e.g., chocolate, chairs, station wagons, etc.). Cross-category substitutes are goods that are members of different taxonomic categories but can satisfy the same goal . A person who cannot have the chocolate that she desires, for example, might instead buy ice cream to satisfy her goal to have a dessert. [3] Substitutability of a good [ edit ] Indifference curve for perfect substitutes Goods that are completely substitutable with each other are called perfect substitutes. They may be characterized as goods having a linear utility function or a constant marginal rate of substitution . [4] Writeable compact disks from different manufacturers are often considered to be perfect substitutes. As the price of one brand of CD rises, consumers will be expected to substitute other brands of CD in a one-to-one fashion. This means that the total quantity of CDs purchased would not change. Imperfect substitutes have a lesser level of substitutability, and therefore exhibit variable marginal rates of substitution along the consumer indifference curve . The consumption points on the curve offer the same level of utility as before but the compensation now depends on the starting point of the substitution. An example of such a product is the soft drink. As the price of Coca-Cola rises, consumers could be expected to substitute Pepsi . However, many consumers prefer one brand of soft drink over the other. Consumers who prefer Coke to Pepsi, for example, will not trade between them in a one-to-one fashion. Rather, a consumer would be willing to give relatively large amounts of Pepsi in exchange for relatively small amounts of Coke. People exhibit a strong preference for within-category substitutes to cross-category substitutes. Across a ten sets of different foods, a majority of research participants (79.7%) believed that a within-category substitute would better satisfy their craving for a food they could not have than a cross-category substitute. Unable to acquire a desired Godiva chocolate, for instance, a majority reported that they would prefer to eat a store-brand chocolate (a within-category substitute) than a chocolate-chip granola bar (a cross-category substitute). This preference for within-category substitutes appears, however, to be misguided. Because within-category substitutes are more similar to the missing good, their inferiority to it is more noticeable. This creates a negative contrast effect , and leads within-category substitutes to be less satisfying substitutes than cross-category substitutes. [3] Monopolistic competition [ edit ] Many markets for commonly used goods feature products which are perfectly substitutable yet are differently branded and marketed, a condition referred to as monopolistic competition . A good example may be the comparison between store brand and name brand versions of medications - the products may be identical but the packaging is differentiated by the vendors. Since the goods are essentially alike, the only genuine difference between them is the price - their vendors rely primarily on price and branding to effect sales. In those sectors consumer choice is usually driven by discriminate according to lowest price , with higher-priced variants relying on a sense of exclusivity created by slicker branding to maintain competitiveness. Gasoline / Petrol Milk Internet connectivity (ISP services) Electricity Telephony Airline tickets Perfect substitutability is significant in the era of deregulation , since there are usually several competing providers in a field (e.g. electricity suppliers) each retailing exactly the same product. The result is often aggressive price competition between the retailers. Perfect competition [ edit ] One of the requirements for perfect competition is that the products of competing firms should be perfect substitutes. When this condition is not satisfied, the market is characterized by product differentiation . Types of substitute goods [ edit ] Unit-demand goods are goods from which the consumer wants only a single item. If the consumer has two items, then his utility is the maximum of the utilities he gains from each of these items. For example, consider a certain consumer that only wants a means of transportation, which may be either a car or a bicycle. His utility from a car is 100 and from a bicycle is 50. If he has both a car and a bicycle, then he uses only the car so his utility is 100. Unit-demand goods are always substitutes , since if the price of one good increases, the consumer will tend to want the other good (Laizer 2016).

For the Iron Maiden song, see Hallowed Be Thy Name (song) . James Tissot \u2013 The Lord's Prayer ( Le Pater Noster )\u00a0\u2013 Brooklyn Museum The Lord's Prayer (also called the Our Father or Pater Noster , among other names) [ examples needed ] is a venerated Christian prayer which, according to the New Testament , Jesus taught as the way to pray: Pray then in this way ... (Matthew 6:9 NRSV ) When you pray, say ... (Luke 11:2 NRSV) Two versions of this prayer are recorded: the long form in the Gospel of Matthew in the middle of the Sermon on the Mount , and the short form in the Gospel of Luke when \"one of his disciples said to him, 'Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples.'\" [1] The first three of the seven petitions in Matthew address God; the other four are related to human needs and concerns. The Matthew account alone includes the \"Your will be done\" and the \"Rescue us from the evil one\" (or \"Deliver us from evil\") petitions. Both original Greek texts contain the adjective epiousios , which does not appear in any other classical or Koine Greek literature; while controversial, \" daily \" has been the most common English-language translation of this word. Some Christians, particularly Protestants , conclude the prayer with a doxology , a later addendum appearing in some manuscripts of Matthew. Matthew 6:9-13 ( RSV-2CE ) Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Luke 11:2-4 (RSV-2CE) Father, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come. Give us each day our daily bread; and forgive us our sins, for we ourselves forgive everyone who is indebted to us; and lead us not into temptation. Initial words on the topic from the Catechism of the Catholic Church teach that it \"is truly the summary of the whole gospel\". [2] The prayer is used by most Christian churches in their worship ; with few exceptions, the liturgical form is the Matthean. Although theological differences and various modes of worship divide Christians, according to Fuller Seminary professor Clayton Schmit, \"there is a sense of solidarity in knowing that Christians around the globe are praying together ... and these words always unite us.\" [3] In biblical criticism , the prayer's absence in the Gospel of Mark together with its occurrence in Matthew and Luke has caused scholars who accept the two-source hypothesis (against other document hypotheses ) to conclude that it is probably a logion original to Q .

English versions [ edit ] Main article: History of the Lord's Prayer in English A crucifix on an open Bible showing an English translation of the prayer (from Matthew) There are several different English translations of the Lord's Prayer from Greek or Latin, beginning around AD 650 with the Northumbrian translation. Of those in current liturgical use, the three best-known are: The translation in the 1662 Anglican Book of Common Prayer (BCP) of the Church of England The slightly modernized form used in the 1928 version of the Prayer Book of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America (along with the doxology ) and in the English vernacular translation of the Catholic Mass The 1988 translation of the ecumenical English Language Liturgical Consultation (ELLC) The square brackets in three of the texts below indicate the doxology often added at the end of the prayer by Protestants and, in a slightly different form, by the Byzantine Rite (\"For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory: of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, now and ever, and unto ages of ages. Amen.\" [13] ), among whom the prayer proper is usually recited by the cantors and congregation in unison, and the doxology by the priest as the conclusion of the prayer. The Anglican Book of Common Prayer adds it in some services but not in all. Older English translations of the Bible, based on late Byzantine Greek manuscripts, included it, but it is excluded in critical editions of the New Testament, such as that of the United Bible Societies . It is absent in the oldest manuscripts and is not considered to be part of the original text of Matthew 6:9 \u2013 13 . The Catholic Church has never attached it to the Lord's Prayer, but has included it in the Roman Rite Mass as revised in 1969, not as part of the Our Father but separated from it by a prayer called the embolism spoken or sung by the priest (in the official ICEL English translation: \"Deliver us, Lord, we pray, from every evil, graciously grant peace in our days, that, by the help of your mercy, we may be always free from sin and safe from all distress, as we await the blessed hope and the coming of our Saviour, Jesus Christ.\") that elaborates on the final petition, \"Deliver us from evil.\" For more information on this doxology, see Doxology , below. When Reformers set out to translate the King James Bible, they assumed that a Greek manuscript they possessed was ancient and therefore adopted the phrase \"For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory forever\" into the Lord\u2019s Prayer. Later scholarship demonstrated that the manuscript was actually a late addition based on Eastern liturgical tradition. 1928 Episcopal BCP (with doxology); [14] Catholic version (without doxology) [15] Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. [ The 1928 BCP adds: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and ever Amen.] 1662 Anglican BCP [16] Our Father, which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name; Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven: Give us this day our daily bread; And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us; And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil: When before the Collect the priest alone recites the prayer, the people here respond : Amen. When after all have communicated the people repeat each petition after the priest, the prayer ends : For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, For ever and ever. Amen. 1988 ELLC [17] Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as in heaven. Give us today our daily bread. Forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. Save us from the time of trial and deliver us from evil. For the kingdom, the power, and the glory are yours now and for ever. Amen. Other English translations are also used. Though Matthew 6:12 uses the term debts , the older English versions of the Lord's Prayer uses the term trespasses , while ecumenical versions often use the term sins . The latter choice may be due to Luke 11:4 , which uses the word sins , while the former may be due to Matthew 6:14 (immediately after the text of the prayer), where Jesus speaks of trespasses . As early as the third century, Origen of Alexandria used the word trespasses ( \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03c4\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 ) in the prayer. Although the Latin form that was traditionally used in Western Europe has debita ( debts ), most English-speaking Christians (except Scottish Presbyterians and some others of the Reformed tradition) use trespasses . The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) , the Established Presbyterian Church of Scotland as well as the Congregational denomination follow the version found in Matthew 6 in the Authorized Version (known also as the King James Version ), which in the prayer uses the words \"debts\" and \"debtors\". All these versions are based on the text in Matthew, rather than Luke, of the prayer given by Jesus: Matthew 6:9\u201313 ( ESV ) \"Pray then like this: 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.'\" Luke 11:2\u20134 ( ESV ) And he said to them, \"When you pray, say: 'Father, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come. Give us each day our daily bread, and forgive us our sins, for we ourselves forgive everyone who is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation.'\" Analysis [ edit ] The Lord's Prayer in Greek Subheadings use 1662 Book of Common Prayer (BCP) (see above) Introduction [ edit ] \"Our Father, which art in heaven\" This explains that God, the Father , rests in Heaven , and the plural word \"Our\" indicates that there are a group of God's children who call him Father. Augustine interpreted \"heaven\" ( coelum , sky) in this context as meaning \"in the hearts of the righteous, as it were in His holy temple\". [18] First Petition [ edit ] \"Hallowed be thy Name;\" See also: Names of God in Christianity and Matthew 6:9 Former Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams explains this phrase as a petition that people may look upon God's name as holy, as something that inspires awe and reverence, and that they may not trivialize it by making God a tool for their purposes, to \"put other people down, or as a sort of magic to make themselves feel safe\". He sums up the meaning of the phrase by saying: \"Understand what you're talking about when you're talking about God, this is serious, this is the most wonderful and frightening reality that we could imagine, more wonderful and frightening than we can imagine.\" [19] Second Petition [ edit ] \"Thy kingdom come;\" See also: Matthew 6:10 \"This petition has its parallel in the Jewish prayer, 'May he establish his Kingdom during your life and during your days.' [20] In the gospels Jesus speaks frequently of God's kingdom, but never defines the concept: \"He assumed this was a concept so familiar that it did not require definition.\" [21] Concerning how Jesus' audience in the gospels would have understood him, G. E. Ladd turns to the concept's Hebrew Biblical background: \"The Hebrew word malkuth [...] refers first to a reign, dominion, or rule and only secondarily to the realm over which a reign is exercised. [...] When malkuth is used of God, it almost always refers to his authority or to his rule as the heavenly King.\" [22] This petition looks to the perfect establishment of God's rule in the world in the future, an act of God resulting in the eschatological order of the new age. [23] The request for God's kingdom to come is commonly interpreted at the most literal level: as a reference to the belief, common at the time, that a Messiah figure would bring about a kingdom of God . [ citation needed ] Traditionally, the coming of God's kingdom is seen as a divine gift to be prayed for, not a human achievement. [ citation needed ] This idea is frequently challenged by groups who believe that the Kingdom will come by the hands of those faithful who work for a better world. These believe that Jesus' commands to feed the hungry and clothe the needy are the kingdom to which he was referring. [ citation needed ] Hilda C. Graef notes that the operative Greek word, basileia, means both kingdom and kingship (i.e., reign, dominion, governing, etc.), but that the English word kingdom loses this double meaning. [24] Kingship adds a psychological meaning to the petition: one is also praying for the condition of soul where one follows God's will. Third Petition [ edit ] \"Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven:\" See also: Matthew 6:10 John Ortberg interprets this phrase as follows: \u201cMany people think our job is to get my afterlife destination taken care of, then tread water till we all get ejected and God comes back and torches this place. But Jesus never told anybody\u2014neither his disciples nor us\u2014to pray, 'Get me out of here so I can go up there.' His prayer was, 'Make up there come down here.' Make things down here run the way they do up there.\u201d [25] The request that \u201cthy will be done\u201d is God\u2019s invitation to \u201cjoin him in making things down here the way they are up there.\u201d [25] Fourth Petition [ edit ] \"Give us this day our daily ( epiousios ) bread;\" See also: Matthew 6:11 See also: Epiousios As mentioned earlier in this article, the original word \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 ( epiousios ), commonly characterized as daily , is unique to the Lord's Prayer in all of ancient Greek literature. The word is almost a hapax legomenon , occurring only in Luke and Matthew's versions of the Lord's Prayer, and nowhere else in any other extant Greek texts. While epiousios is often substituted by the word \"daily,\" all other New Testament translations from the Greek into \"daily\" otherwise reference hemeran (\u1f21\u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd, \"the day\"), which does not appear in this usage. [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] Via linguistic parsing , Jerome translated \"\u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd\" ( epiousios ) as \"supersubstantialem\" in the Gospel of Matthew, but chose \"cotidianum\" (\"daily\") in the Gospel of Luke. This wide-ranging difference with respect to meaning of epiousios is discussed in detail in the current Catechism of the Catholic Church by way of an inclusive approach toward tradition as well as a literal one for meaning: \"Taken in a temporal sense, this word is a pedagogical repetition of \"this day,\" to confirm us in trust \"without reservation.\" Taken in the qualitative sense, it signifies what is necessary for life, and more broadly every good thing sufficient for subsistence. Taken literally (epi-ousios: \"super-essential\"), it refers directly to the Bread of Life , the Body of Christ , the \"medicine of immortality,\" without which we have no life within us.\" [37] Epiousios is translated as supersubstantialem in the Vulgate ( Matthew 6:11 ) and accordingly as supersubstantial in the Douay-Rheims Bible ( Matthew 6:11 ). Barclay M. Newman's A Concise Greek-English Dictionary of the New Testament , published in a revised edition in 2010 by the United Bible Societies has the following entry: \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9|\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, \u03bf\u03bd (\u03b5\u1f30\u03bc\u03af) of doubtful meaning, for today ; for the coming day ; necessary for existence [38] It thus derives the word from the preposition \u1f10\u03c0\u03af ( epi ) and the verb \u03b5\u1f30\u03bc\u03af ( eimi ), from the latter of which are derived words such as \u03bf\u1f50\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 ( ousia ), the range of whose meanings is indicated in A Greek-English Lexicon . [39] Fifth Petition [ edit ] \"And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us;\" See also: Matthew 6:12 The Presbyterian and other Reformed churches tend to use the rendering \"forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors\". Roman Catholics, Anglicans and Methodists are more likely to say \"trespasses ... those who trespass against us\". [40] The \"debts\" form appears in the first English translation of the Bible, by John Wycliffe in 1395 (Wycliffe spelling \"dettis\"). The \"trespasses\" version appears in the 1526 translation by William Tyndale (Tyndale spelling \"treaspases\"). In 1549 the first Book of Common Prayer in English used a version of the prayer with \"trespasses\". This became the \"official\" version used in Anglican congregations. After the request for bread, Matthew and Luke diverge slightly. Matthew continues with a request for debts to be forgiven in the same manner as people have forgiven those who have debts against them. Luke, on the other hand, makes a similar request about sins being forgiven in the manner of debts being forgiven between people. The word \"debts\" ( \u1f40\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bb\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 ) does not necessarily mean financial obligations, as shown by the use of the verbal form of the same word ( \u1f40\u03c6\u03b5\u03af\u03bb\u03b5\u03c4\u03b5 ) in passages such as Romans 13:8 . The Aramaic word \u1e25\u00f4b\u00e2 can mean \"debt\" or \"sin\". [41] [42] This difference between Luke's and Matthew's wording could be explained by the original form of the prayer having been in Aramaic. The generally accepted interpretation is thus that the request is for forgiveness of sin, not of supposed loans granted by God. [43] Asking for forgiveness from God was a staple of Jewish prayers. [ citation needed ] It was also considered proper for individuals to be forgiving of others, so the sentiment expressed in the prayer would have been a common one of the time. [ citation needed ] Anthony C. Deane , Canon of Worcester Cathedral , suggested that the choice of the word \"\u1f40\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bb\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\" (debts), rather than \"\u1f01\u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\u03c2\" (sins), indicates a reference to failures to use opportunities of doing good. He linked this with the parable of the sheep and the goats (also in Matthew's Gospel), in which the grounds for condemnation are not wrongdoing in the ordinary sense, but failure to do right, missing opportunities for showing love to others. [Matt. 25:31\u201346] [44] \"As we forgive...\". Divergence between Matthew's \"debts\" and Luke's \"sins\" is relatively trivial compared to the impact of the second half of this statement. The verses immediately following the Lord's Prayer, [Matt. 6:14\u201315] show Jesus teaching that the forgiveness of our sin/debt (by God) is contingent on how we forgive others. Later, Matthew elaborates with Jesus' Parable of the Unforgiving Servant . [Matt. 18:23\u201335] In this parable, forgiveness from the king (God) is conditional on the servant's forgiveness of a small debt owed to him. Sixth Petition [ edit ] \"And lead us not into temptation,\" See also: Matthew 6:13 Interpretations of the penultimate petition of the prayer\u2014not to be led by God into peirasmos \u2014vary considerably. The range of meanings of the Greek word \"\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2\" (peirasmos) is illustrated in New Testament Greek lexicons. [45] In different contexts it can mean temptation, testing, trial, experiment. Although the traditional English translation uses the word \" temptation \" and Carl Jung saw God as actually leading people astray, [46] Christians generally interpret the petition as not contradicting James 1:13\u201314 : \"Let no one say when he is tempted, 'I am being tempted by God', for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempts no one. But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire.\" Some see the petition as an eschatological appeal against unfavourable Last Judgment , a theory supported by the use of the word \"peirasmos\" in this sense in Revelation 3:10 . Others see it as a plea against hard tests described elsewhere in scripture, such as those of Job . [47] It is also read as: \"Do not let us be led (by ourselves, by others, by Satan) into temptations\". Since it follows shortly after a plea for daily bread (i.e., material sustenance), it is also seen as referring to not being caught up in the material pleasures given. A similar phrase appears in Matthew 26:41 and Luke 22:40 in connection with the prayer of Jesus in Gethsemane. [48] Joseph Smith , the founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , in a translation of the Holy Bible which was not completed before his death, used this wording: \"And suffer us not to be led into temptation\". [49] In 2017, Pope Francis , speaking on the Italian TV channel TV2000 , proposed that the wording be changed to \"do not let us fall into temptation\", explaining that \"it is I who fall, it is not God who throws me into temptation\". [50] Seventh Petition [ edit ] \"But deliver us from evil:\" See also: Matthew 6:13 Translations and scholars are divided over whether the final word here refers to \" evil \" in general or \"the evil one\" (the devil ) in particular. In the original Greek, as well as in the Latin translation, the word could be either of neuter (evil in general) or masculine (the evil one) gender. Matthew's version of the prayer appears in the Sermon on the Mount , in earlier parts of which the term is used to refer to general evil. Later parts of Matthew refer to the devil when discussing similar issues. However, the devil is never referred to as the evil one in any known Aramaic sources. While John Calvin accepted the vagueness of the term's meaning, he considered that there is little real difference between the two interpretations, and that therefore the question is of no real consequence. Similar phrases are found in John 17:15 and 2\u00a0Thessalonians\u00a03:3 . [51] Doxology [ edit ] \"For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, For ever and ever. Amen.\" See also: Matthew 6:13 The doxology of the prayer is not contained in Luke's version, nor is it present in the earliest manuscripts of Matthew, [52] representative of the Alexandrian text, although it is present in the manuscripts representative of the later Byzantine text . [53] Most scholars do not consider it part of the original text of Matthew. [54] [55] New translations generally omit it. [56] The first known use of the doxology, in a less lengthy form (\"for yours is the power and the glory forever\"), [57] as a conclusion for the Lord's Prayer (in a version slightly different from that of Matthew) is in the Didache , 8:2. It has similarities with 1\u00a0Chronicles \u2014\"Yours, O LORD, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty, for all that is in the heavens and in the earth is yours. Yours is the kingdom, O LORD, and you are exalted as head above all.\" In the Byzantine Rite, a similar doxology is sung within the context of the Divine Liturgy . Following the last line of the prayer, the priest sings \"For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory, of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, now and ever and unto ages of ages.\" Latin Church Roman Catholics do not use the doxology when reciting the Lord's Prayer, because it is not part of their received liturgical tradition and is not found in the Latin Vulgate of St. Jerome . Since 1970 it is included in the Roman Rite Mass as an independent item, not as part of the Lord's Prayer. The Anglican Book of Common Prayer sometimes gives the Lord's Prayer with the doxology, sometimes without. [58] Most Protestants append it to the Lord's Prayer. Use as a language comparison tool [ edit ] Detail of the Europa Polyglotta published with Synopsis Universae Philologiae in 1741; the map gives the first phrase of the Lord's Prayer in 33 different languages of Europe . In the course of Christianization , one of the first texts to be translated between many languages has historically been the Lord's Prayer, long before the full Bible would be translated into the respective languages . Since the 16th century, collections of translations of the prayer have often been used for a quick comparison of languages. The first such collection, with 22 versions, was Mithridates de differentis linguis by Conrad Gessner (1555; the title refers to Mithridates VI of Pontus who according to Pliny the Elder was an exceptional polyglot ). Gessner's idea of collecting translations of the prayer was taken up by authors of the 17th century, including Hieronymus Megiserus (1603) and Georg Pistorius (1621). Thomas L\u00fcdeken in 1680 published an enlarged collection of 83 versions of the prayer, of which three were in fictional philosophical languages . L\u00fcdeken quotes as a Barnum Hagius as his source for the exotic scripts used, while their true (anonymous) author was Andreas M\u00fcller. In 1700, L\u00fcbeck's collection was re-edited by B. Mottus as Oratio dominica plus centum linguis versionibus aut characteribus reddita et expressa . This edition was comparatively inferior, but a second, revised edition was published in 1715 by John Chamberlain. This 1715 edition was used by Gottfried Hensel in his Synopsis Universae Philologiae (1741) to compile \"geographico-polyglot maps\" where the beginning of the prayer was shown in the geographical area where the respective languages were spoken. Johann Ulrich Kraus also published a collection with more than 100 entries. [59] Lord's Prayer in Classical Chinese These collections continued to be improved and expanded well into the 19th century; Johann Christoph Adelung and Johann Severin Vater in 1806\u20131817 published the prayer in \"well-nigh five hundred languages and dialects\". [60] Samples of scripture, including the Lord's Prayer, were published in 52 oriental languages, most of them not previously found in such collections, translated by the brethren of the Serampore Mission and printed at the mission press there in 1818. Relation to Jewish prayer [ edit ] There are similarities between the Lord's Prayer and both biblical and post-biblical material in Jewish prayer especially Kiddushin 81a (Babylonian). [61] \"Hallowed be thy name\" is reflected in the Kaddish . \"Lead us not into sin\" is echoed in the \" morning blessings \" of Jewish prayer. A blessing said by some Jewish communities after the evening Shema includes a phrase quite similar to the opening of the Lord's Prayer: \"Our God in heaven, hallow thy name, and establish thy kingdom forever, and rule over us for ever and ever. Amen.\" There are parallels also in 1\u00a0Chronicles\u00a029:10\u201318 . [62] Rabbi Aron Mendes Chumaceiro has said [63] that nearly all the elements of the prayer have counterparts in the Jewish Bible and Deuterocanonical books : the first part in Isaiah 63:15\u201316 (\"Look down from heaven and see, from your holy and beautiful habitation ... For you are our Father ...\") and Ezekiel 36:23 (\"I will vindicate the holiness of my great name ...\") and Ezekiel 38:23 (\"I will show my greatness and my holiness and make myself known in the eyes of many nations ...\"), the second part in Obadiah 1:21 (\"Saviours shall go up to Mount Zion to rule Mount Esau, and the kingdom shall be the L ORD 's\") and 1\u00a0Samuel\u00a03:18 (\"... It is the L ORD . Let him do what seems good to him\"), the third part in Proverbs 30:8 (\"... feed me with my apportioned bread\"), the fourth part in Sirach 28:2 (\"Forgive your neighbour the wrong he has done, and then your sins will be pardoned when you pray\"). \"Deliver us from evil\" can be compared with Psalm 119:133 (\"... let no iniquity get dominion over me.\"). Chumaceiro says that, because the idea of God leading a human into temptation contradicts the righteousness and love of God, \"Lead us not into temptation\" has no counterpart in the Jewish Bible/Christian Old Testament. The word \"\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2\", which is translated as \"temptation\", could also be translated as \"test\" or \"trial\", making evident the attitude of someone's heart. Well-known examples in the Old Testament are God's test of Abraham ( Genesis 22:1 ), his \"moving\" (the Hebrew word means basically \"to prick, as by weeds, thorns\") David to do (numbering Israel) what David later acknowledged as sin ( 2\u00a0Samuel\u00a024:1\u201310 ; see also 1\u00a0Chronicles\u00a021:1\u20137 ), and the Book of Job . Musical settings [ edit ] In modern times, various composers have incorporated The Lord's Prayer into a musical setting for utilization during liturgical services for a variety of religious traditions as well as interfaith ceremonies. Included among them are: 9th-10th century: Gregorian chant 1878: Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky \u2014 Otche Nash (\u041e\u0442\u0447\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0448; Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom, op. 41) 1883: Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov \u2014 Otche Nash 1910: Sergei Rachmaninoff \u2014 Otche Nash (\u041e\u0442\u0447\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0448; Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom , op. 31) 1926: Igor Stravinsky \u2014 Otche Nash (1926), arr.

Issues Civilizing mission Manifest Destiny Lands inhabited by indigenous peoples Discovery doctrine Indigenism Legal representation ILO 107 ILO 169 United Nations Declaration Category v t e The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) was adopted by the General Assembly on Thursday, 13 September 2007, by a majority of 144 states in favour, 4 votes against (Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States) and 11 abstentions (Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Burundi, Colombia, Georgia, Kenya, Nigeria, Russian Federation, Samoa and Ukraine). [1] The work towards this declaration can be seen as far as in 1923 and 1925 by the works of Haudenosaunee Chief Deskaheh and M\u0101ori T.W. Ratana who attempted to bring issues of Canada and New Zealand failure to uphold treaties \u00a0to the League of Nations [precursor to the United Nations]. [2] [3] In May 2016 Canada officially removed its objector status to UNDRIP, almost a decade after it was adopted by the General Assembly. By now also the other 3 objectors have, to various degrees, turned their vote. While as a General Assembly Declaration it is not a legally binding instrument under international law , [4] according to a UN press release it does \"represent the dynamic development of international legal norms and it reflects the commitment of the UN's member states to move in certain directions\"; the UN describes it as setting \"an important standard for the treatment of indigenous peoples that will undoubtedly be a significant tool towards eliminating human rights violations against the planet's 370 million indigenous people and assisting them in combating discrimination and marginalisation .\" UNDRIP codifies \"Indigenous historical grievances, contemporary challenges and socio-economic, political and cultural aspirations\" and is the \"culmination of generations-long efforts by Indigenous organizations to get international attention, to secure recognition for their aspirations, and to generate support for their political agendas.\" [5] Canada Research Chair and faculty member at the University of Saskatchewan [6] [7] Ken Coates argues that UNDRIP resonates powerfully with Indigenous peoples, while national governments have not yet fully understood its impact.

The Declaration sets out the individual and collective rights of Indigenous peoples, as well as their rights to culture, identity, language, employment, health, education and other issues. It also \"emphasizes the rights of Indigenous peoples to maintain and strengthen their own institutions, cultures and traditions, and to pursue their development in keeping with their own needs and aspirations\". [8] It \"prohibits discrimination against indigenous peoples\", and it \"promotes their full and effective participation in all matters that concern them and their right to remain distinct and to pursue their own visions of economic and social development\". [8] [9] The goal of the Declaration is to encourage countries to work alongside indigenous peoples to solve global issues, like development, multicultural democracy and decentralization. [10] According to Article 31, there is a major emphasis that the indigenous peoples will be able to protect their cultural heritage and other aspects of their culture and tradition in order to preserve their heritage from over controlling nation-states. The elaboration of this Declaration had already been recommended by the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action . [11] This declaration is a resolution, meaning it is not a law bearing document. \u00a0Indigenous people are not considered a country [nation - state] and do not have right to international law protection through the international court of justice. Article 40 states that Indigenous peoples have right to fair procedures for the resolution of conflicts and dispute with countries or other parties , because Indigenous people cannot use the International court of justice, UNDRIP has \u00a0no indication of which judicial power indigenous peoples are to bring disputes to. [12] Content [ edit ] The Declaration is structured as a United Nations resolution , with 23 preambular clauses and 46 articles. In most articles, an aspiration for how the State should promote and protect the rights of indigenous people is included (see Provision for further explanation). Major themes of the articles include: Rights of self-determination of indigenous individuals and peoples (Articles 1 - 8; 33 -34) The difference is between the individual and people\u2019s group Rights of indigenous individuals and people to protect their culture through practices, languages, education, media, and religion (Articles 9 - 15, 16, 25, and 31) Asserts the indigenous peoples\u2019 right to own type of governance and to economic development (Articles 17 - 21, 35 -37) Health rights (Article 23 -24) Protection of subgroups ex. elderly, women, an children (Article 22) Land rights from ownership (including reparation, or return of land i.e. Article 10) to environmental issues (Articles 26 -30, and 32) Dictates how this document should be understood in future reference(Articles 38 - 46). [13] Provisions [ edit ] The opening and Article 2 of the Declaration provide that \u201cindigenous peoples are equal to all other peoples\u201d (source). Besides asserting the rights that indigenous individuals and peoples\u2019 \u00a0have as other peoples, there are Articles (23 of the 46) pointing to how States should interact with the declaration. Most of the articles point to States working in conjunction with the indigenous peoples. Some measures countries are suggested to take are to return land (article 26), ceremonial objects (article 12), and human remains (article 12) To place \u201cprogrammes for monitoring, maintaining, and restoring the health of indigenous peoples\u201d (article 29 ) To protect and uphold the rights of indigenous individuals and peoples (subpoint in many articles; see Declaration) [14] Negotiation and adoption [ edit ] UN General Assembly Resolution 61/295 Date 13 December 2007 Code A/61/295\u00a0( Document ) Subject Indigenous rights Voting summary 143 voted for 4 voted against 11 abstained Result Adopted The Declaration was over 25 years in the making. The idea originated in 1982 when the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) set up its Working Group on Indigenous Populations (WGIP), established as a result of a study by Special Rapporteur Jos\u00e9 Ricardo Mart\u00ednez Cobo on the problem of discrimination faced by indigenous peoples. Tasked with developing human rights standards that would protect indigenous peoples, in 1985 the Working Group began working on drafting the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The draft was finished in 1993 and was submitted to the Sub-Commission on the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities , which gave its approval the following year. During this the International Labour Organisation adopted the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 . The Draft Declaration was then referred to the Commission on Human Rights , which established another Working Group to examine its terms. Over the following years this Working Group met on 11 occasions to examine and fine-tune the Draft Declaration and its provisions. Progress was slow because of certain states' concerns regarding some key provisions of the Declaration, such as indigenous peoples' right to self-determination and the control over natural resources existing on indigenous peoples' traditional lands. [15] The final version of the Declaration was adopted on 29 June 2006 by the 47-member Human Rights Council (the successor body to the Commission on Human Rights), with 30 member states in favour, 2 against, 12 abstentions, and 3 absentees. [16] The Declaration (document A/61/L.67) was then referred to the General Assembly, which voted on the adoption of the proposal on 13 September 2007 during its 61st regular session. [17] The vote was, in favour 143 countries: Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Andorra, Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia, Austria, Bahamas, Bahrain, Barbados, Belarus, Belgium, Belize, Benin, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brazil, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chile, China, Comoros, Congo, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Denmark, Djibouti, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Estonia, Finland, France, Gabon, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Guatemala, Guinea, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Latvia, Lebanon, Lesotho, Liberia, Libya, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Madagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, Maldives, Mali, Malta, Mauritius, Mexico, Micronesia (Federated States of), Moldova, Monaco, Mongolia, Mozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, Nepal, Netherlands, Nicaragua, Niger, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, San Marino, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Suriname, Swaziland, Sweden, Switzerland, Syria, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United Republic of Tanzania, Uruguay, Venezuela, Viet Nam, Yemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe. Against : Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United States. All four member states that voted against have their origins as colonies of the United Kingdom, and have large non-indigenous immigrant majorities and thriving indigenous populations. Since then, all four countries have moved to endorse the declaration in some informal way in which it would not actually become binding law pleadable in court. Canada since 2006 has made official public statements that directly attack the UN DRIP, e.g. \"Indian Affairs Minister Jim Prentice has stated publicly that the Declaration conflicts with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms but has never substantiated this extraordinary claim.\" [18] Australian government interventions have been challenged under its terms without success. [19] Abstaining , 11 countries: [20] Azerbaijan , Bangladesh, Bhutan , Burundi, Colombia , Georgia, Kenya, Nigeria , Russian Federation , Samoa and Ukraine . Colombia and Samoa have since endorsed the document. [21] Absent : [22] Chad, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Fiji, Gambia, Grenada, Guinea-Bissau, Israel, Kiribati, Kyrgyzstan, Marshall Islands, Mauritania, Montenegro, Morocco, Nauru, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Romania, Rwanda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, Seychelles, Solomon Islands, Somalia, Tajikistan, Togo, Tonga, Turkmenistan, Tuvalu, Uganda, Uzbekistan, Vanuatu. Reaction [ edit ] Support and compromises [ edit ] In contrast to the Declaration's initial rejection by Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States over legal concerns (all 4 countries later switched their positions to 'supporting' the declaration as a non-legally-binding document), United Nations officials and other world leaders expressed pleasure at its adoption. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon described it as a \"historic moment when UN Member States and indigenous peoples have reconciled with their painful histories and are resolved to move forward together on the path of human rights, justice and development for all.\" Louise Arbour , a former justice of the Supreme Court of Canada then serving as the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights , expressed satisfaction at the hard work and perseverance that had finally \"borne fruit in the most comprehensive statement to date of indigenous peoples' rights.\" [9] Similarly, news of the Declaration's adoption was greeted with jubilation in Africa [23] and, present at the General Assembly session in New York, Bolivian foreign minister David Choquehuanca said that he hoped the member states that had voted against or abstained would reconsider their refusal to support a document he described as being as important as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . [24] Bolivia has become the first country to approve the U.N. declaration of indigenous rights. Evo Morales , President of Bolivia , stated, \"We are the first country to turn this declaration into a law and that is important, brothers and sisters. We recognize and salute the work of our representatives. But if we were to remember the indigenous fight clearly, many of us who are sensitive would end up crying in remembering the discrimination, the scorn.\" Stephen Corry , Director of the international indigenous rights organization Survival International , said, \"The declaration has been debated for nearly a quarter century. Years which have seen many tribal peoples, such as the Akuntsu and Kano\u00ea in Brazil, decimated and others, such as the Innu in Canada, brought to the edge. Governments that oppose it are shamefully fighting against the human rights of their most vulnerable peoples. Claims they make to support human rights in other areas will be seen as hypocritical.\" [25] Australia [ edit ] The Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies formally acknowledges and upholds the principles of the Declaration in both their Collection Access and Use Policy [26] and their Guidelines for Ethical Research in Australian Indigenous Studies. [27] Criticism, defiance and \"aspirational\" nullification [ edit ] Prior to the adoption of the Declaration, and throughout the 62nd session of the General Assembly, a number of countries expressed concern about some key issues, such as self-determination , access to lands, territories and resources and the lack of a clear definition of the term \"indigenous\". [28] In addition to those intending to vote against the adoption of the declaration, a group of African countries represented by Namibia proposed to defer action, to hold further consultations, and to conclude consideration of the declaration by September 2007. [29] Ultimately, after agreeing on some adjustments to the Draft Declaration, a vast majority of states recognized that these issues could be addressed by each country at the national level. The four states that voted against continued to express serious reservations about the final text of the Declaration as placed before the General Assembly. [30] As mentioned above, all four opposing countries have since then changed their vote in favour of the Declaration. Australia [ edit ] Australia's government opposed the Declaration in the General Assembly vote of 2007, but has since endorsed the Declaration. Australia's Mal Brough , Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and of partial Australian Aboriginal ancestry, referring to the provision regarding the upholding of indigenous peoples' customary legal systems, said that \"There should only be one law for all Australians and we should not enshrine in law practices that are not acceptable in the modern world.\" [17] Marise Payne , Liberal Party Senator for New South Wales , further elaborated on the Australian government's objections to the Declaration in a speech to the Australian Senate : [31] Concerns about references to self-determination and their potential to be misconstrued. Ignorance of contemporary realities concerning land and resources. \"They seem, to many readers, to require the recognition of Indigenous rights to lands which are now lawfully owned by other citizens, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous, and therefore to have some quite significant potential to impact on the rights of third parties.\" [31] Concerns over the extension of Indigenous intellectual property rights under the declaration as unnecessary under current international and Australian law. The potential abuse of the right under the Declaration for indigenous peoples to unqualified consent on matters affecting them, \"which implies to some readers that they may then be able to exercise a right of veto over all matters of state, which would include national laws and other administrative measures.\" [31] The exclusivity of indigenous rights over intellectual, real and cultural property, that \"does not acknowledge the rights of third parties \u2013 in particular, their rights to access Indigenous land and heritage and cultural objects where appropriate under national law.\" [31] Furthermore, that the Declaration \"fails to consider the different types of ownership and use that can be accorded to Indigenous people and the rights of third parties to property in that regard.\" [31] Concerns that the Declaration places indigenous customary law in a superior position to national law, and that this may \"permit the exercise of practices which would not be acceptable across the board\", [31] such as customary corporal and capital punishments. In October 2007 former Australian Prime Minister John Howard pledged to hold a referendum on changing the constitution to recognise indigenous Australians if re-elected. He said that the distinctiveness of people's identity and their rights to preserve their heritage should be acknowledged. [32] On 3 April 2009, the Rudd Government formally endorsed the Declaration. [33] Canada [ edit ] The Canadian government said that while it supported the \"spirit\" of the declaration, it contained elements that were \"fundamentally incompatible with Canada's constitutional framework \", [17] which includes both the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and Section 35 , which enshrines aboriginal and treaty rights. In particular, the Canadian government had problems with Article 19 (which appears to require governments to secure the consent of indigenous peoples regarding matters of general public policy), and Articles 26 and 28 (which could allow for the re-opening or repudiation of historically settled land claims). [34] Former Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development Chuck Strahl described the document as \"unworkable in a Western democracy under a constitutional government.\" [35] Strahl elaborated, saying \"In Canada, you are balancing individual rights vs. collective rights, and (this) document ... has none of that. By signing on, you default to this document by saying that the only rights in play here are the rights of the First Nations . And, of course, in Canada, that's inconsistent with our constitution.\" He gave an example: \"In Canada ... you negotiate on this ... because (native rights) don't trump all other rights in the country. You need also to consider the people who have sometimes also lived on those lands for two or three hundred years, and have hunted and fished alongside the First Nations.\" [36] The Assembly of First Nations passed a resolution in December 2007 to invite Presidents Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Evo Morales to Canada to put pressure on the government to sign the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, calling the two heads of state \"visionary leaders\" and demanding Canada resign its membership on the United Nations Human Rights Council . [37] On 3 March 2010, in the Speech From the Throne , the Governor General of Canada announced that the government was moving to endorse the declaration. \"We are a country with an Aboriginal heritage. A growing number of states have given qualified recognition to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Our Government will take steps to endorse this aspirational document in a manner fully consistent with Canada\u2019s Constitution and laws.\" On 12 November 2010, Canada officially endorsed the declaration but without changing its position that it was 'aspirational'. [38] Anishinabek spiritual leader, Chief William Commanda (1908-3 August 2011) was honoured at the 21st annual week-long First Peoples' Festival held in Montreal from 2\u20139 August 2011, celebrating Canada's 2010 adoption of the U. N. declaration. AFN Innu representative, Ghislain Picard's tribute praised Grandfather Commanda for his work that was \"key not only in the adoption of the U.N. declaration, but in all the work leading up to it throughout the last 25 years.\" [39] In 2015, Romeo Saganash (a Cree Member of Parliament for Abitibi\u2014Baie-James\u2014Nunavik\u2014Eeyou ) sponsored Private Member's Bill C-641, the \"United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act\", which would have required the Canadian government to ensure that the laws of Canada are in harmony with UNDRIP but it was defeated on May 6, 2015. [40] In 2016, Canada officially adopted and promised to implement the declaration fully. Speaking at the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues , Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada minister Carolyn Bennett announced, \"We are now a full supporter of the declaration, without qualification. We intend nothing less than to adopt and implement the declaration in accordance with the Canadian Constitution.\" [41] Bennett described the Declaration as \"breathing life into Section 35 [of the Canadian Constitution ] and recognizing it as a full box of rights for Indigenous Peoples in Canada.\" [41] In July 2016, Kwakwaka\u2019wakw Justice Minister Jody Wilson-Raybould gave a speech that stated that \"adopting the UNDRIP as being Canadian law are unworkable\", due to its incompatibility with the Indian Act , the current governing statute. [42] The federal government pledged on 21 June 2017 to rename its National Aboriginal Day to be consistent with the terminology used by the Declaration. [43] In September 2017, British Columbia provincial government announced that it will govern in accordance with the principles outlined in the Declaration. [44] New Zealand [ edit ] New Zealand delegation at the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues . New Zealand endorsed the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in April 2010. In 2007 New Zealand's Minister of M\u0101ori Affairs Parekura Horomia described the Declaration as \"toothless\", and said, \"There are four provisions we have problems with, which make the declaration fundamentally incompatible with New Zealand's constitutional and legal arrangements.\" Article 26 in particular, he said, \"appears to require recognition of rights to lands now lawfully owned by other citizens, both indigenous and non-indigenous. This ignores contemporary reality and would be impossible to implement.\" [45] In response, M\u0101ori Party leader Pita Sharples said it was \"shameful to the extreme that New Zealand voted against the outlawing of discrimination against indigenous people; voted against justice, dignity and fundamental freedoms for all\". [46] On 7 July 2009, the New Zealand government announced that it would support the Declaration; this, however, appeared to be a premature announcement by Pita Sharples , the current Minister of M\u0101ori Affairs, as the New Zealand government cautiously backtracked on Sharples' July announcement. [47] However, on 19 April 2010, Sharples announced New Zealand's support of the declaration at a speech in New York. [48] [49] United States [ edit ] Speaking for the United States mission to the UN, spokesman Benjamin Chang said, \"What was done today is not clear. The way it stands now is subject to multiple interpretations and doesn't establish a clear universal principle.\" [50] The U.S. mission also issued a floor document, \"Observations of the United States with respect to the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples\", setting out its objections to the Declaration. Most of these are based on the same points as the three other countries' rejections but, in addition, the United States drew attention to the Declaration's failure to provide a clear definition of exactly whom the term \"indigenous peoples\" is intended to cover. [51] On 16 December 2010, President Obama declared that the United States would \"lend its support\" to the Declaration. The decision was announced during the second White House Tribal Nations Conference, where he said he is \"working hard to live up to\" the name that was given to him by the Crow Nation: \"One Who Helps People Throughout the Land.\" Obama has told Native American leaders that he wants to improve the \"nation-to-nation\" relationship between the United States and the tribes and repair broken promises. Today, there are more than 560 Indian tribes [52] in the United States that are recognized at the federal level , with some sixty-plus tribes recognized at the state level . Many had representatives at the White House conference and applauded Obama's announcement. [53] The Obama administration's decision came after three consultation meetings with Native Americans and more than 3,000 written comments on the subject. [54] The support of the government also included several interpretations of the meaning of the Declaration. In the view of the United States government, the Declaration advances \"a new and distinct international concept of self-determination specific to indigenous peoples,\" which is not the same as the existing concept in international law. [54] The statement also interprets free, prior, and informed consent, \"which the United States understands to call for a process of meaningful consultation with tribal leaders, but not necessarily the agreement of those leaders, before the actions addressed in those consultations are taken.\" [54] United Kingdom [ edit ] Speaking on behalf of the United Kingdom government, UK Ambassador and Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Karen Pierce , \"emphasized that the Declaration was non-legally binding and did not propose to have any retroactive application on historical episodes. National minority groups and other ethnic groups within the territory of the United Kingdom and its overseas territories did not fall within the scope of the indigenous peoples to which the Declaration applied.\" [55] The UK position was also clearly intended to prevent formal appeal of Canadian decisions to UK courts: Canadian indigenous peoples never accepted the 1982 constitution in which such appeal (regarding early treaties made with the Crown of the British Empire) was cut off. Under the prior 1867 constitution, 1920s Dominion of Canada and earlier law, which continue to apply to these peoples and treaties, the UN DRIP could have been pleaded in a UK court in conflicts between treaty and Canadian law. Calls to pursue this approach have been common among Canadian natives. [6] Finland [ edit ] Finland signed the International Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples when it was originally put forward. [56] [57] However the reindeer owners and Forest Administration ( Mets\u00e4hallitus ) have a long dispute in the area of the forests. [58] The UN Human Rights Committee ordered the Finnish State to stop logging in some of the disputed areas. [ citation needed ] Abstentions [ edit ] Ukraine [ edit ] Ukraine, which initially abstained from adopting the Declaration, changed its approach to indigenous issues in response to the recent annexation of Crimea , asserting that Crimean Tatars are an Indigenous people. In May 2014, the country formally endorsed the UNDRIP. [59] Pacific Island states [ edit ] Ten UN member states in the Pacific, all with indigenous majorities, were absent from the assembly at the time of the vote: Fiji , Kiribati , Marshall Islands , Nauru , Palau , Papua New Guinea , Solomon Islands , Tonga , Tuvalu , Vanuatu . It is unclear whether this represents the equivalent of deliberate abstention, or whether the country delegations were absent for some other reason. The constitutions of these states typically make mention of \"indigenous inhabitants\" and accommodate customary laws in at least part of their modern legal systems. The constitution of Papua New Guinea , for example, has an explanatory section on the \" underlying law \" being based on custom, while Sch.1.2. says that \"custom\" means \"the customs and usages of indigenous inhabitants of the country ...\" (emphasis added). It may be the case, therefore, that the governments of these states took the position that their own legal systems offered sufficient protection to their own indigenous peoples. There has been no suggestion at any time since decolonisation commenced in the 1960s and the present that indigenous people are absent from any of the ten countries. Nonetheless, Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu are among countries in this group plagued by land grabbing in recent years. [60] Researchers have warned that as much as 12% of the land surface of Papua New Guinea has been leased without informed consultation and consent from landowners, typically suppressing customary rights for 99 years. [61] Given that land grabbing was recently ruled to lie within the remit of the International Criminal Court , [62] it is a reasonable conclusion that legal systems in the Pacific, unsupported by UNDRIP, have insufficient built-in safeguards for the protection of indigenous rights. There are also significant implications in the extractive sector for these states not having signed UNDRIP. Mining companies that are members of the International Council on Mining and Metals commit to respect the ICMM's position statement on indigenous peoples . However, ambiguity surrounds how or if member companies recognise when they are dealing with indigenous peoples. For example, Barrick Gold lists only its operations in North and South America as lying on indigenous land, yet operates in Fiji and Papua New Guinea (where a subsidiary has operated the Porgera gold mine since 2007). [63] Another member, Newmont Mining , said in its 2011 Sustainability Report [64] that it had been conducting mining exploration in Papua New Guinea for three years, yet its disclosures do not show how activities in this country may have followed the ICCM's Indigenous Peoples and Mining Good Practice Guide , first published in 2010.

[8] [9] Her father is of Mexican descent while her mother, who was adopted, has some Italian ancestry. [10] [11] [12] Regarding her Hispanic heritage, Gomez has stated, \"My family does have Quincea\u00f1eras , and we go to the communion church. We do everything that's Catholic, but we don't really have anything traditional except [that we] go to the park and have barbecues on Sundays after church.\" [13] Gomez's parents divorced when she was five years old, and she remained with her mother. [5] [14] Selena has two siblings: Gracie Elliot Teefey was born to Amanda and her second husband Brian Teefey on June 12, 2013; [15] [16] and Victoria \"Tori\" Gomez was born to Ricardo and his wife Sara Gomez on June 25, 2014.

[19] The family had financial troubles during Gomez's childhood, with her mother struggling to provide for the pair. [20] At one point, Gomez recalled, they had to search for quarters just to get gas for their car. [20] Her mother later recalled that the two would frequently walk to their local dollar store to purchase spaghetti for dinner. [20] Gomez stated, \"I was frustrated that my parents weren't together, and never saw the light at the end of the tunnel where my mom was working hard to provide a better life for me. I'm terrified of what I would have become if I'd stayed [in Texas].\" [21] She later added that \"[My mom] was really strong around me. Having me at 16 had to have been a big responsibility. She gave up everything for me, had three jobs, supported me, sacrificed her life for me.\" [22] Gomez had a close relationship with her grandparents as a child, and appeared in various pageants growing up. [22] Her grandparents often took care of her while her parents finished their schooling, and the pair went as far as stating that they \"raised her\" up until she found success in the entertainment industry.

[23] She began auditioning for various roles, meeting Demi Lovato during an audition for Barney & Friends .

[28] The show was her first experience in acting, with Gomez recalling, \"I was very shy when I was little [...] I didn't know what 'camera right' was. I didn't know what blocking was. I learned everything from Barney .\" [29] Gomez appeared in fourteen episodes of the show between 2002 and 2004, though the show's producers released her as she was getting \"too old\" for the series. [30] While working on the series, Gomez had a cameo role in the film Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over (2003) and the made-for-television film Walker, Texas Ranger: Trial by Fire (2005).

[35] She later auditioned for a role in the Disney series Wizards of Waverly Place , ultimately winning the lead role of Alex Russo . [30] Upon receiving the role, Gomez and her mother moved to Hollywood, Los Angeles, California ; Lovato and her family also moved to Hollywood, hoping to achieve similar success to Gomez.

[48] Later that year, Gomez had the supporting role of Helga in the animated film Horton Hears a Who! [49] The film was a commercial success, and went on to gross nearly $300\u00a0million worldwide. [50] At 16 years of age, Gomez was signed to a recording contract with the Hollywood Records label, which had already signed both Cyrus and Lovato. [51] [52] Gomez formed her own production company in 2008, which she called July Moon Productions. [53] [54] She partnered with XYZ Films for the project, giving Gomez the opportunity to option articles, hire writers and create talent packages to shop to studios. [55] [56] Gomez was slated to release two films under the company. The first, titled What Boys Want , with Gomez as a girl who could hear the thoughts of men. [57] She later announced a film adaptation of the novel Thirteen Reasons Why , in which she was to play a young girl who commits suicide; ultimately, neither film was released, [58] though Gomez would later executive produce a television adaptation of Thirteen Reasons Why .

[69] Gomez performing in 2011 Hoping to achieve a successful crossover into music, Gomez formed the pop-rock band Selena Gomez & the Scene through her record deal with Hollywood Records.

{"question": "4 types of brain wave classifications as recognized by an eeg machine", "answer": "", "context": "Electroencephalography - Wikipedia Electroencephalography From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search Not to be confused with other types of electrography . \"EEG\" redirects here. For other uses, see EEG (disambiguation) . Electroencephalography Epileptic spike and wave discharges monitored with EEG [ edit on Wikidata ] Electroencephalography ( EEG ) is an electrophysiological monitoring method to record electrical activity of the brain . It is typically noninvasive, with the electrodes placed along the scalp , although invasive electrodes are sometimes used such as in electrocorticography . EEG measures voltage fluctuations resulting from ionic current within the neurons of the brain . [1] In clinical contexts, EEG refers to the recording of the brain's spontaneous electrical activity over a period of time, [1] as recorded from multiple electrodes placed on the scalp. Diagnostic applications generally focus either on event-related potentials or on the spectral content of EEG. The former investigates potential fluctuations time locked to an event like stimulus onset or button press. The latter analyses the type of neural oscillations (popularly called \"brain waves\") that can be observed in EEG signals in the frequency domain. EEG is most often used to diagnose epilepsy , which causes abnormalities in EEG readings. [2] It is also used to diagnose sleep disorders , depth of anesthesia , coma , encephalopathies , and brain death . EEG used to be a first-line method of diagnosis for tumors , stroke and other focal brain disorders, [3] [4] but this use has decreased with the advent of high-resolution anatomical imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT). Despite limited spatial resolution, EEG continues to be a valuable tool for research and diagnosis. It is one of the few mobile techniques available and offers millisecond-range temporal resolution which is not possible with CT, PET or MRI. Derivatives of the EEG technique include evoked potentials (EP), which involves averaging the EEG activity time-locked to the presentation of a stimulus of some sort (visual, somatosensory , or auditory). Event-related potentials (ERPs) refer to averaged EEG responses that are time-locked to more complex processing of stimuli; this technique is used in cognitive science , cognitive psychology , and psychophysiological research.

The upper tracing is EEG, and the lower is a 10 Hz timing signal. Hans Berger The history of EEG is detailed by Barbara E. Swartz in Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology . [5] In 1875, Richard Caton (1842\u20131926), a physician practicing in Liverpool , presented his findings about electrical phenomena of the exposed cerebral hemispheres of rabbits and monkeys in the British Medical Journal . In 1890, Polish physiologist Adolf Beck published an investigation of spontaneous electrical activity of the brain of rabbits and dogs that included rhythmic oscillations altered by light. Beck started experiments on the electrical brain activity of animals. Beck placed electrodes directly on the surface of brain to test for sensory stimulation. His observation of fluctuating brain activity led to the conclusion of brain waves. [6] In 1912, Russian physiologist Vladimir Vladimirovich Pravdich-Neminsky published the first animal EEG and the evoked potential of the mammalian (dog). [7] In 1914, Napoleon Cybulski and Jelenska-Macieszyna photographed EEG recordings of experimentally induced seizures. German physiologist and psychiatrist Hans Berger (1873\u20131941) recorded the first human EEG in 1924. [8] Expanding on work previously conducted on animals by Richard Caton and others, Berger also invented the electroencephalogram (giving the device its name), an invention described \"as one of the most surprising, remarkable, and momentous developments in the history of clinical neurology\". [9] His discoveries were first confirmed by British scientists Edgar Douglas Adrian and B. H. C. Matthews in 1934 and developed by them. In 1934, Fisher and Lowenback first demonstrated epileptiform spikes. In 1935, Gibbs, Davis and Lennox described inter ictal spike waves and the three cycles/s pattern of clinical absence seizures , which began the field of clinical electroencephalography. Subsequently, in 1936 Gibbs and Jasper reported the interictal spike as the focal signature of epilepsy. The same year, the first EEG laboratory opened at Massachusetts General Hospital. Franklin Offner (1911\u20131999), professor of biophysics at Northwestern University developed a prototype of the EEG that incorporated a piezoelectric inkwriter called a Crystograph (the whole device was typically known as the Offner Dynograph ). In 1947, The American EEG Society was founded and the first International EEG congress was held. In 1953 Aserinsky and Kleitman described REM sleep. In the 1950s, William Grey Walter developed an adjunct to EEG called EEG topography , which allowed for the mapping of electrical activity across the surface of the brain. This enjoyed a brief period of popularity in the 1980s and seemed especially promising for psychiatry. It was never accepted by neurologists and remains primarily a research tool. In 1988, report was given on EEG control of a physical object, a robot. [10] [11] Medical use [ edit ] An EEG recording setup A routine clinical EEG recording typically lasts 20\u201330 minutes (plus preparation time) and usually involves recording from scalp electrodes. Routine EEG is typically used in clinical circumstances to distinguish epileptic seizures from other types of spells, such as psychogenic non-epileptic seizures , syncope (fainting) , sub-cortical movement disorders and migraine variants, to differentiate \"organic\" encephalopathy or delirium from primary psychiatric syndromes such as catatonia , to serve as an adjunct test of brain death , to prognosticate, in certain instances, in patients with coma, and to determine whether to wean anti-epileptic medications. At times, a routine EEG is not sufficient, particularly when it is necessary to record a patient while he/she is having a seizure. In this case, the patient may be admitted to the hospital for days or even weeks, while EEG is constantly being recorded (along with time-synchronized video and audio recording). A recording of an actual seizure (i.e., an ictal recording, rather than an inter-ictal recording of a possibly epileptic patient at some period between seizures) can give significantly better information about whether or not a spell is an epileptic seizure and the focus in the brain from which the seizure activity emanates. Epilepsy monitoring is typically done to distinguish epileptic seizures from other types of spells, such as psychogenic non-epileptic seizures , syncope (fainting) , sub-cortical movement disorders and migraine variants, to characterize seizures for the purposes of treatment, and to localize the region of brain from which a seizure originates for work-up of possible seizure surgery. Additionally, EEG may be used to monitor the depth of anesthesia , as an indirect indicator of cerebral perfusion in carotid endarterectomy , or to monitor amobarbital effect during the Wada test . EEG can also be used in intensive care units for brain function monitoring to monitor for non-convulsive seizures/non-convulsive status epilepticus, to monitor the effect of sedative/anesthesia in patients in medically induced coma (for treatment of refractory seizures or increased intracranial pressure ), and to monitor for secondary brain damage in conditions such as subarachnoid hemorrhage (currently a research method). If a patient with epilepsy is being considered for resective surgery , it is often necessary to localize the focus (source) of the epileptic brain activity with a resolution greater than what is provided by scalp EEG. This is because the cerebrospinal fluid , skull and scalp smear the electrical potentials recorded by scalp EEG. In these cases, neurosurgeons typically implant strips and grids of electrodes (or penetrating depth electrodes) under the dura mater , through either a craniotomy or a burr hole . The recording of these signals is referred to as electrocorticography (ECoG), subdural EEG (sdEEG) or intracranial EEG (icEEG)--all terms for the same thing. The signal recorded from ECoG is on a different scale of activity than the brain activity recorded from scalp EEG. Low voltage, high frequency components that cannot be seen easily (or at all) in scalp EEG can be seen clearly in ECoG. Further, smaller electrodes (which cover a smaller parcel of brain surface) allow even lower voltage, faster components of brain activity to be seen. Some clinical sites record from penetrating microelectrodes. [1] EEG is not indicated for diagnosing headache. [12] Recurring headache is a common pain problem, and this procedure is sometimes used in a search for a diagnosis, but it has no advantage over routine clinical evaluation. [12] Research use [ edit ] EEG, and the related study of ERPs are used extensively in neuroscience , cognitive science , cognitive psychology , neurolinguistics and psychophysiological research. Many EEG techniques used in research are not standardised sufficiently for clinical use. But research on mental disabilities, such as auditory processing disorder (APD), ADD , or ADHD , is becoming more widely known and EEGs are used as research and treatment. Advantages [ edit ] Several other methods to study brain function exist, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) , positron emission tomography , magnetoencephalography (MEG), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy , electrocorticography , single-photon emission computed tomography , near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and event-related optical signal (EROS). Despite the relatively poor spatial sensitivity of EEG, it possesses multiple advantages over some of these techniques: Hardware costs are significantly lower than those of most other techniques [13] EEG prevents limited availability of technologists to provide immediate care in high traffic hospitals. [14] EEG sensors can be used in more places than fMRI, SPECT, PET, MRS, or MEG, as these techniques require bulky and immobile equipment. For example, MEG requires equipment consisting of liquid helium -cooled detectors that can be used only in magnetically shielded rooms, altogether costing upwards of several million dollars; [15] and fMRI requires the use of a 1-ton magnet in, again, a shielded room. EEG has very high temporal resolution, on the order of milliseconds rather than seconds. EEG is commonly recorded at sampling rates between 250 and 2000\u00a0Hz in clinical and research settings, but modern EEG data collection systems are capable of recording at sampling rates above 20,000\u00a0Hz if desired. MEG and EROS are the only other noninvasive cognitive neuroscience techniques that acquire data at this level of temporal resolution. [15] EEG is relatively tolerant of subject movement, unlike most other neuroimaging techniques. There even exist methods for minimizing, and even eliminating movement artifacts in EEG data [16] EEG is silent, which allows for better study of the responses to auditory stimuli. EEG does not aggravate claustrophobia , unlike fMRI, PET, MRS, SPECT, and sometimes MEG [17] EEG does not involve exposure to high-intensity (>1 tesla) magnetic fields, as in some of the other techniques, especially MRI and MRS. These can cause a variety of undesirable issues with the data, and also prohibit use of these techniques with participants that have metal implants in their body, such as metal-containing pacemakers [18] EEG does not involve exposure to radioligands, unlike positron emission tomography . [19] ERP studies can be conducted with relatively simple paradigms, compared with IE block-design fMRI studies Extremely uninvasive, unlike Electrocorticography , which actually requires electrodes to be placed on the surface of the brain. EEG also has some characteristics that compare favorably with behavioral testing: EEG can detect covert processing (i.e., processing that does not require a response) [20] EEG can be used in subjects who are incapable of making a motor response [21] Some ERP components can be detected even when the subject is not attending to the stimuli Unlike other means of studying reaction time, ERPs can elucidate stages of processing (rather than just the final end result) [22] EEG is a powerful tool for tracking brain changes during different phases of life. EEG sleep analysis can indicate significant aspects of the timing of brain development, including evaluating adolescent brain maturation. [23] In EEG there is a better understanding of what signal is measured as compared to other research techniques, i.e. the BOLD response in MRI. Disadvantages [ edit ] Low spatial resolution on the scalp. fMRI , for example, can directly display areas of the brain that are active, while EEG requires intense interpretation just to hypothesize what areas are activated by a particular response. [24] EEG poorly measures neural activity that occurs below the upper layers of the brain (the cortex). Unlike PET and MRS, cannot identify specific locations in the brain at which various neurotransmitters, drugs, etc. can be found. [19] Often takes a long time to connect a subject to EEG, as it requires precise placement of dozens of electrodes around the head and the use of various gels, saline solutions, and/or pastes to keep them in place (although a cap can be used). While the length of time differs dependent on the specific EEG device used, as a general rule it takes considerably less time to prepare a subject for MEG, fMRI, MRS, and SPECT. Signal-to-noise ratio is poor, so sophisticated data analysis and relatively large numbers of subjects are needed to extract useful information from EEG [25] With other neuroimaging techniques [ edit ] Simultaneous EEG recordings and fMRI scans have been obtained successfully, [26] [27] though successful simultaneous recording requires that several technical difficulties be overcome, such as the presence of ballistocardiographic artifact, MRI pulse artifact and the induction of electrical currents in EEG wires that move within the strong magnetic fields of the MRI. While challenging, these have been successfully overcome in a number of studies. [28] MRI's produce detailed images created by generating strong magnetic fields that may induce potentially harmful displacement force and torque. These fields produce potentially harmful radio frequency heating and create image artifacts rendering images useless. Due to these potential risks, only certain medical devices can be used in an MR environment. Similarly, simultaneous recordings with MEG and EEG have also been conducted, which has several advantages over using either technique alone: EEG requires accurate information about certain aspects of the skull that can only be estimated, such as skull radius, and conductivities of various skull locations. MEG does not have this issue, and a simultaneous analysis allows this to be corrected for. MEG and EEG both detect activity below the surface of the cortex very poorly, and like EEG, the level of error increases with the depth below the surface of the cortex one attempts to examine. However, the errors are very different between the techniques, and combining them thus allows for correction of some of this noise. MEG has access to virtually no sources of brain activity below a few centimetres under the cortex. EEG, on the other hand, can receive signals from greater depth, albeit with a high degree of noise. Combining the two makes it easier to determine what in the EEG signal comes from the surface (since MEG is very accurate in examining signals from the surface of the brain), and what comes from deeper in the brain, thus allowing for analysis of deeper brain signals than either EEG or MEG on its own. [29] Recently, a combined EEG/MEG (EMEG) approach has been investigated for the purpose of source reconstruction in epilepsy diagnosis. [30] EEG has also been combined with positron emission tomography . This provides the advantage of allowing researchers to see what EEG signals are associated with different drug actions in the brain. [31] Mechanisms [ edit ] The brain's electrical charge is maintained by billions of neurons . [32] Neurons are electrically charged (or \"polarized\") by membrane transport proteins that pump ions across their membranes. Neurons are constantly exchanging ions with the extracellular milieu, for example to maintain resting potential and to propagate action potentials . Ions of similar charge repel each other, and when many ions are pushed out of many neurons at the same time, they can push their neighbours, who push their neighbours, and so on, in a wave. This process is known as volume conduction. When the wave of ions reaches the electrodes on the scalp, they can push or pull electrons on the metal in the electrodes. Since metal conducts the push and pull of electrons easily, the difference in push or pull voltages between any two electrodes can be measured by a voltmeter . Recording these voltages over time gives us the EEG. [33] The electric potential generated by an individual neuron is far too small to be picked up by EEG or MEG. [34] EEG activity therefore always reflects the summation of the synchronous activity of thousands or millions of neurons that have similar spatial orientation. If the cells do not have similar spatial orientation, their ions do not line up and create waves to be detected. Pyramidal neurons of the cortex are thought to produce the most EEG signal because they are well-aligned and fire together. Because voltage field gradients fall off with the square of distance, activity from deep sources is more difficult to detect than currents near the skull. [35] Scalp EEG activity shows oscillations at a variety of frequencies. Several of these oscillations have characteristic frequency ranges , spatial distributions and are associated with different states of brain functioning (e.g., waking and the various sleep stages ). These oscillations represent synchronized activity over a network of neurons. The neuronal networks underlying some of these oscillations are understood (e.g., the thalamocortical resonance underlying sleep spindles ), while many others are not (e.g., the system that generates the posterior basic rhythm). Research that measures both EEG and neuron spiking finds the relationship between the two is complex, with a combination of EEG power in the gamma band and phase in the delta band relating most strongly to neuron spike activity. [36] Method [ edit ] Computer electroencephalograph Neurovisor-BMM 40 In conventional scalp EEG, the recording is obtained by placing electrodes on the scalp with a conductive gel or paste, usually after preparing the scalp area by light abrasion to reduce impedance due to dead skin cells. Many systems typically use electrodes, each of which is attached to an individual wire. Some systems use caps or nets into which electrodes are embedded; this is particularly common when high-density arrays of electrodes are needed. Electrode locations and names are specified by the International 10\u201320 system [37] for most clinical and research applications (except when high-density arrays are used). This system ensures that the naming of electrodes is consistent across laboratories. In most clinical applications, 19 recording electrodes (plus ground and system reference) are used. [38] A smaller number of electrodes are typically used when recording EEG from neonates . Additional electrodes can be added to the standard set-up when a clinical or research application demands increased spatial resolution for a particular area of the brain. High-density arrays (typically via cap or net) can contain up to 256 electrodes more-or-less evenly spaced around the scalp. Each electrode is connected to one input of a differential amplifier (one amplifier per pair of electrodes); a common system reference electrode is connected to the other input of each differential amplifier. These amplifiers amplify the voltage between the active electrode and the reference (typically 1,000\u2013100,000 times, or 60\u2013100 dB of voltage gain). In analog EEG, the signal is then filtered (next paragraph), and the EEG signal is output as the deflection of pens as paper passes underneath. Most EEG systems these days, however, are digital, and the amplified signal is digitized via an analog-to-digital converter , after being passed through an anti-aliasing filter . Analog-to-digital sampling typically occurs at 256\u2013512\u00a0Hz in clinical scalp EEG; sampling rates of up to 20\u00a0kHz are used in some research applications. During the recording, a series of activation procedures may be used. These procedures may induce normal or abnormal EEG activity that might not otherwise be seen. These procedures include hyperventilation, photic stimulation (with a strobe light), eye closure, mental activity, sleep and sleep deprivation. During (inpatient) epilepsy monitoring, a patient's typical seizure medications may be withdrawn. The digital EEG signal is stored electronically and can be filtered for display. Typical settings for the high-pass filter and a low-pass filter are 0.5\u20131 Hz and 35\u201370\u00a0Hz respectively. The high-pass filter typically filters out slow artifact, such as electrogalvanic signals and movement artifact, whereas the low-pass filter filters out high-frequency artifacts, such as electromyographic signals. An additional notch filter is typically used to remove artifact caused by electrical power lines (60\u00a0Hz in the United States and 50\u00a0Hz in many other countries). [1] The EEG signals can be captured with opensource hardware such as OpenBCI and the signal can be processed by freely available EEG software such as EEGLAB or the Neurophysiological Biomarker Toolbox . As part of an evaluation for epilepsy surgery, it may be necessary to insert electrodes near the surface of the brain, under the surface of the dura mater . This is accomplished via burr hole or craniotomy . This is referred to variously as \"electrocorticography (ECoG)\" , \"intracranial EEG (I-EEG)\" or \"subdural EEG (SD-EEG)\". Depth electrodes may also be placed into brain structures, such as the amygdala or hippocampus , structures, which are common epileptic foci and may not be \"seen\" clearly by scalp EEG. The electrocorticographic signal is processed in the same manner as digital scalp EEG (above), with a couple of caveats. ECoG is typically recorded at higher sampling rates than scalp EEG because of the requirements of Nyquist theorem \u2014the subdural signal is composed of a higher predominance of higher frequency components. Also, many of the artifacts that affect scalp EEG do not impact ECoG, and therefore display filtering is often not needed. A typical adult human EEG signal is about 10 \u00b5V to 100 \u00b5V in amplitude when measured from the scalp [39] and is about 10\u201320 mV when measured from subdural electrodes. Since an EEG voltage signal represents a difference between the voltages at two electrodes, the display of the EEG for the reading encephalographer may be set up in one of several ways. The representation of the EEG channels is referred to as a montage. Sequential montage Each channel (i.e., waveform) represents the difference between two adjacent electrodes. The entire montage consists of a series of these channels. For example, the channel \"Fp1-F3\" represents the difference in voltage between the Fp1 electrode and the F3 electrode. The next channel in the montage, \"F3-C3\", represents the voltage difference between F3 and C3, and so on through the entire array of electrodes. Referential montage Each channel represents the difference between a certain electrode and a designated reference electrode. There is no standard position for this reference; it is, however, at a different position than the \"recording\" electrodes. Midline positions are often used because they do not amplify the signal in one hemisphere vs. the other. Another popular reference is \"linked ears\", which is a physical or mathematical average of electrodes attached to both earlobes or mastoids . Average reference montage The outputs of all of the amplifiers are summed and averaged, and this averaged signal is used as the common reference for each channel. Laplacian montage Each channel represents the difference between an electrode and a weighted average of the surrounding electrodes. [40] When analog (paper) EEGs are used, the technologist switches between montages during the recording in order to highlight or better characterize certain features of the EEG. With digital EEG, all signals are typically digitized and stored in a particular (usually referential) montage; since any montage can be constructed mathematically from any other, the EEG can be viewed by the electroencephalographer in any display montage that is desired. The EEG is read by a clinical neurophysiologist or neurologist (depending on local custom and law regarding medical specialities ), optimally one who has specific training in the interpretation of EEGs for clinical purposes. This is done by visual inspection of the waveforms, called graphoelements. The use of computer signal processing of the EEG\u2014so-called quantitative electroencephalography \u2014is somewhat controversial when used for clinical purposes (although there are many research uses). Limitations [ edit ] EEG has several limitations. Most important is its poor spatial resolution. [41] EEG is most sensitive to a particular set of post-synaptic potentials: those generated in superficial layers of the cortex, on the crests of gyri directly abutting the skull and radial to the skull. Dendrites, which are deeper in the cortex, inside sulci , in midline or deep structures (such as the cingulate gyrus or hippocampus ), or producing currents that are tangential to the skull, have far less contribution to the EEG signal. EEG recordings do not directly capture axonal action potentials . An action potential can be accurately represented as a current quadrupole , meaning that the resulting field decreases more rapidly than the ones produced by the current dipole of post-synaptic potentials. [42] In addition, since EEGs represent averages of thousands of neurons, a large population of cells in synchronous activity is necessary to cause a significant deflection on the recordings. Action potentials are very fast and, as a consequence, the chances of field summation are slim. However, neural backpropagation , as a typically longer dendritic current dipole, can be picked up by EEG electrodes and is a reliable indication of the occurrence of neural output. Not only do EEGs capture dendritic currents almost exclusively as opposed to axonal currents, they also show a preference for activity on populations of parallel dendrites and transmitting current in the same direction at the same time. Pyramidal neurons of cortical layers II/III and V extend apical dendrites to layer I. Currents moving up or down these processes underlie most of the signals produced by electroencephalography. [43] Therefore, EEG provides information with a large bias to select neuron types, and generally should not be used to make claims about global brain activity. The meninges , cerebrospinal fluid and skull \"smear\" the EEG signal, obscuring its intracranial source. It is mathematically impossible to reconstruct a unique intracranial current source for a given EEG signal, [1] as some currents produce potentials that cancel each other out. This is referred to as the inverse problem . However, much work has been done to produce remarkably good estimates of, at least, a localized electric dipole that represents the recorded currents. [ citation needed ] EEG vs fMRI, fNIRS and PET [ edit ] EEG has several strong points as a tool for exploring brain activity. EEGs can detect changes over milliseconds, which is excellent considering an action potential takes approximately 0.5\u2013130 milliseconds to propagate across a single neuron, depending on the type of neuron. [44] Other methods of looking at brain activity, such as PET and fMRI have time resolution between seconds and minutes. EEG measures the brain's electrical activity directly, while other methods record changes in blood flow (e.g., SPECT , fMRI ) or metabolic activity (e.g., PET , NIRS ), which are indirect markers of brain electrical activity. EEG can be used simultaneously with fMRI so that high-temporal-resolution data can be recorded at the same time as high-spatial-resolution data, however, since the data derived from each occurs over a different time course, the data sets do not necessarily represent exactly the same brain activity. There are technical difficulties associated with combining these two modalities, including the need to remove the MRI gradient artifact present during MRI acquisition and the ballistocardiographic artifact (resulting from the pulsatile motion of blood and tissue) from the EEG. Furthermore, currents can be induced in moving EEG electrode wires due to the magnetic field of the MRI. EEG can be used simultaneously with NIRS without major technical difficulties. There is no influence of these modalities on each other and a combined measurement can give useful information about electrical activity as well as local hemodynamics. EEG vs MEG [ edit ] EEG reflects correlated synaptic activity caused by post-synaptic potentials of cortical neurons . The ionic currents involved in the generation of fast action potentials may not contribute greatly to the averaged field potentials representing the EEG. [34] [45] More specifically, the scalp electrical potentials that produce EEG are generally thought to be caused by the extracellular ionic currents caused by dendritic electrical activity, whereas the fields producing magnetoencephalographic signals [15] are associated with intracellular ionic currents. [46] EEG can be recorded at the same time as MEG so that data from these complementary high-time-resolution techniques can be combined. Studies on numerical modeling of EEG and MEG have also been done.

Right: power spectra of shown signals (vertical lines \u2013 10 and 20\u00a0Hz, scale is linear). 80\u201390% of people have prominent sinusoidal-like waves with frequencies in 8\u201312\u00a0Hz range \u2013 alpha rhythm. Others (like this) lack this type of activity. The samples of main types of artifacts in human EEG. 1: Electrooculographic artifact caused by the excitation of eyeball's muscles (related to blinking, for example). Big-amplitude, slow, positive wave prominent in frontal electrodes. 2: Electrode's artifact caused by bad contact (and thus bigger impedance) between P3 electrode and skin. 3: Swallowing artifact. 4: Common reference electrode's artifact caused by bad contact between reference electrode and skin. Huge wave similar in all channels. The EEG is typically described in terms of (1) rhythmic activity and (2) transients. The rhythmic activity is divided into bands by frequency. To some degree, these frequency bands are a matter of nomenclature (i.e., any rhythmic activity between 8\u201312\u00a0Hz can be described as \"alpha\"), but these designations arose because rhythmic activity within a certain frequency range was noted to have a certain distribution over the scalp or a certain biological significance. Frequency bands are usually extracted using spectral methods (for instance Welch) as implemented for instance in freely available EEG software such as EEGLAB or the Neurophysiological Biomarker Toolbox . Computational processing of the EEG is often named quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG). Most of the cerebral signal observed in the scalp EEG falls in the range of 1\u201320\u00a0Hz (activity below or above this range is likely to be artifactual, under standard clinical recording techniques). Waveforms are subdivided into bandwidths known as alpha, beta, theta, and delta to signify the majority of the EEG used in clinical practice. [48] Comparison of EEG bands Band Frequency (Hz) Location Normally Pathologically Delta < 4 frontally in adults, posteriorly in children; high-amplitude waves adult slow-wave sleep in babies Has been found during some continuous-attention tasks [49] subcortical lesions diffuse lesions metabolic encephalopathy hydrocephalus deep midline lesions Theta 4\u20137 Found in locations not related to task at hand higher in young children drowsiness in adults and teens idling Associated with inhibition of elicited responses (has been found to spike in situations where a person is actively trying to repress a response or action). [49] focal subcortical lesions metabolic encephalopathy deep midline disorders some instances of hydrocephalus Alpha 8\u201315 posterior regions of head, both sides, higher in amplitude on dominant side. Central sites (c3-c4) at rest relaxed/reflecting closing the eyes Also associated with inhibition control, seemingly with the purpose of timing inhibitory activity in different locations across the brain. coma Beta 16\u201331 both sides, symmetrical distribution, most evident frontally; low-amplitude waves range span: active calm \u2192 intense \u2192 stressed \u2192 mild obsessive active thinking, focus, high alert, anxious benzodiazepines Dup15q syndrome [50] Gamma > 32 Somatosensory cortex Displays during cross-modal sensory processing (perception that combines two different senses, such as sound and sight) [51] [52] Also is shown during short-term memory matching of recognized objects, sounds, or tactile sensations A decrease in gamma-band activity may be associated with cognitive decline, especially when related to the theta band; however, this has not been proven for use as a clinical diagnostic measurement Mu 8\u201312 Sensorimotor cortex Shows rest-state motor neurons. [53] Mu suppression could indicate that motor mirror neurons are working. Deficits in Mu suppression, and thus in mirror neurons, might play a role in autism . [54] The practice of using only whole numbers in the definitions comes from practical considerations in the days when only whole cycles could be counted on paper records. This leads to gaps in the definitions, as seen elsewhere on this page. The theoretical definitions have always been more carefully defined to include all frequencies. Unfortunately there is no agreement in standard reference works on what these ranges should be \u2013 values for the upper end of alpha and lower end of beta include 12, 13, 14 and 15. If the threshold is taken as 14\u00a0Hz, then the slowest beta wave has about the same duration as the longest spike (70\u00a0ms), which makes this the most useful value. EEG Frequency bands: Improved definitions [55] Band Frequency (Hz) Delta < 4 Theta \u2265 4 and < 8 Alpha \u2265 8 and < 14 Beta \u2265 14 Others sometimes divide the bands into sub-bands for the purposes of data analysis. Human EEG with prominent alpha-rhythm Wave patterns [ edit ] Delta waves Delta is the frequency range up to 4\u00a0Hz. It tends to be the highest in amplitude and the slowest waves. It is seen normally in adults in slow-wave sleep . It is also seen normally in babies. It may occur focally with subcortical lesions and in general distribution with diffuse lesions, metabolic encephalopathy hydrocephalus or deep midline lesions. It is usually most prominent frontally in adults (e.g. FIRDA \u2013 frontal intermittent rhythmic delta) and posteriorly in children (e.g. OIRDA \u2013 occipital intermittent rhythmic delta). Theta waves Theta is the frequency range from 4\u00a0Hz to 7\u00a0Hz. Theta is seen normally in young children. It may be seen in drowsiness or arousal in older children and adults; it can also be seen in meditation . [56] Excess theta for age represents abnormal activity. It can be seen as a focal disturbance in focal subcortical lesions; it can be seen in generalized distribution in diffuse disorder or metabolic encephalopathy or deep midline disorders or some instances of hydrocephalus. On the contrary this range has been associated with reports of relaxed, meditative, and creative states. Alpha waves Alpha is the frequency range from 7 Hz to 13\u00a0Hz. [57] Hans Berger named the first rhythmic EEG activity he saw as the \"alpha wave\". This was the \"posterior basic rhythm\" (also called the \"posterior dominant rhythm\" or the \"posterior alpha rhythm\"), seen in the posterior regions of the head on both sides, higher in amplitude on the dominant side. It emerges with closing of the eyes and with relaxation, and attenuates with eye opening or mental exertion. The posterior basic rhythm is actually slower than 8\u00a0Hz in young children (therefore technically in the theta range). Sensorimotor rhythm aka mu rhythm In addition to the posterior basic rhythm, there are other normal alpha rhythms such as the mu rhythm (alpha activity in the contralateral sensory and motor cortical areas) that emerges when the hands and arms are idle; and the \"third rhythm\" (alpha activity in the temporal or frontal lobes). [58] [59] Alpha can be abnormal; for example, an EEG that has diffuse alpha occurring in coma and is not responsive to external stimuli is referred to as \"alpha coma\". Beta waves Beta is the frequency range from 14\u00a0Hz to about 30\u00a0Hz. It is seen usually on both sides in symmetrical distribution and is most evident frontally. Beta activity is closely linked to motor behavior and is generally attenuated during active movements. [60] Low-amplitude beta with multiple and varying frequencies is often associated with active, busy or anxious thinking and active concentration. Rhythmic beta with a dominant set of frequencies is associated with various pathologies, such as Dup15q syndrome , and drug effects, especially benzodiazepines . It may be absent or reduced in areas of cortical damage. It is the dominant rhythm in patients who are alert or anxious or who have their eyes open. Gamma waves Gamma is the frequency range approximately 30\u2013100\u00a0Hz. Gamma rhythms are thought to represent binding of different populations of neurons together into a network for the purpose of carrying out a certain cognitive or motor function. [1] Mu range is 8\u201313\u00a0Hz and partly overlaps with other frequencies. It reflects the synchronous firing of motor neurons in rest state. Mu suppression is thought to reflect motor mirror neuron systems, because when an action is observed, the pattern extinguishes, possibly because of the normal neuronal system and the mirror neuron system \"go out of sync\" and interfere with each other. [54] \"Ultra-slow\" or \"near- DC \" activity is recorded using DC amplifiers in some research contexts. It is not typically recorded in a clinical context because the signal at these frequencies is susceptible to a number of artifacts. Some features of the EEG are transient rather than rhythmic. Spikes and sharp waves may represent seizure activity or interictal activity in individuals with epilepsy or a predisposition toward epilepsy. Other transient features are normal: vertex waves and sleep spindles are seen in normal sleep. Note that there are types of activity that are statistically uncommon, but not associated with dysfunction or disease. These are often referred to as \"normal variants\". The mu rhythm is an example of a normal variant. The normal electroencephalography (EEG) varies by age. The neonatal EEG is quite different from the adult EEG. The EEG in childhood generally has slower frequency oscillations than the adult EEG. The normal EEG also varies depending on state. The EEG is used along with other measurements ( EOG , EMG ) to define sleep stages in polysomnography . Stage I sleep (equivalent to drowsiness in some systems) appears on the EEG as drop-out of the posterior basic rhythm. There can be an increase in theta frequencies. Santamaria and Chiappa cataloged a number of the variety of patterns associated with drowsiness. Stage II sleep is characterized by sleep spindles \u2013 transient runs of rhythmic activity in the 12\u201314\u00a0Hz range (sometimes referred to as the \"sigma\" band) that have a frontal-central maximum. Most of the activity in Stage II is in the 3\u20136\u00a0Hz range. Stage III and IV sleep are defined by the presence of delta frequencies and are often referred to collectively as \"slow-wave sleep\". Stages I\u2013IV comprise non-REM (or \"NREM\") sleep. The EEG in REM (rapid eye movement) sleep appears somewhat similar to the awake EEG. EEG under general anesthesia depends on the type of anesthetic employed. With halogenated anesthetics, such as halothane or intravenous agents, such as propofol , a rapid (alpha or low beta), nonreactive EEG pattern is seen over most of the scalp, especially anteriorly; in some older terminology this was known as a WAR (widespread anterior rapid) pattern, contrasted with a WAIS (widespread slow) pattern associated with high doses of opiates . Anesthetic effects on EEG signals are beginning to be understood at the level of drug actions on different kinds of synapses and the circuits that allow synchronized neuronal activity (see: http://www.stanford.edu/group/maciverlab/ ). Artifacts [ edit ] Biological artifacts [ edit ] Main types of artifacts in human EEG Electrical signals detected along the scalp by an EEG, but that originate from non-cerebral origin are called artifacts . EEG data is almost always contaminated by such artifacts. The amplitude of artifacts can be quite large relative to the size of amplitude of the cortical signals of interest. This is one of the reasons why it takes considerable experience to correctly interpret EEGs clinically. Some of the most common types of biological artifacts include: Eye-induced artifacts (includes eye blinks, eye movements and extra-ocular muscle activity) ECG (cardiac) artifacts EMG (muscle activation)-induced artifacts Glossokinetic artifacts The most prominent eye-induced artifacts are caused by the potential difference between the cornea and retina , which is quite large compared to cerebral potentials. When the eyes and eyelids are completely still, this corneo-retinal dipole does not affect EEG. However, blinks occur several times per minute, the eyes movements occur several times per second. Eyelid movements, occurring mostly during blinking or vertical eye movements, elicit a large potential seen mostly in the difference between the Electrooculography (EOG) channels above and below the eyes. An established explanation of this potential regards the eyelids as sliding electrodes that short-circuit the positively charged cornea to the extra-ocular skin. [61] [62] Rotation of the eyeballs, and consequently of the corneo-retinal dipole, increases the potential in electrodes towards which the eyes are rotated, and decrease the potentials in the opposing electrodes. [63] Eye movements called saccades also generate transient electromyographic potentials, known as saccadic spike potentials (SPs). [64] The spectrum of these SPs overlaps the gamma-band (see Gamma wave ), and seriously confounds analysis of induced gamma-band responses, [65] requiring tailored artifact correction approaches. [64] Purposeful or reflexive eye blinking also generates electromyographic potentials, but more importantly there is reflexive movement of the eyeball during blinking that gives a characteristic artifactual appearance of the EEG (see Bell's phenomenon ). Eyelid fluttering artifacts of a characteristic type were previously called Kappa rhythm (or Kappa waves). It is usually seen in the prefrontal leads, that is, just over the eyes. Sometimes they are seen with mental activity. They are usually in the Theta (4\u20137\u00a0Hz) or Alpha (7\u201314\u00a0Hz) range. They were named because they were believed to originate from the brain. Later study revealed they were generated by rapid fluttering of the eyelids, sometimes so minute that it was difficult to see. They are in fact noise in the EEG reading, and should not technically be called a rhythm or wave. Therefore, current usage in electroencephalography refers to the phenomenon as an eyelid fluttering artifact, rather than a Kappa rhythm (or wave). [66] Some of these artifacts can be useful in various applications. The EOG signals, for instance, can be used to detect [64] and track eye-movements , which are very important in polysomnography , and is also in conventional EEG for assessing possible changes in alertness, drowsiness or sleep. ECG artifacts are quite common and can be mistaken for spike activity. Because of this, modern EEG acquisition commonly includes a one-channel ECG from the extremities. This also allows the EEG to identify cardiac arrhythmias that are an important differential diagnosis to syncope or other episodic/attack disorders. Glossokinetic artifacts are caused by the potential difference between the base and the tip of the tongue. Minor tongue movements can contaminate the EEG, especially in parkinsonian and tremor disorders. Environmental artifacts [ edit ] In addition to artifacts generated by the body, many artifacts originate from outside the body. Movement by the patient, or even just settling of the electrodes, may cause electrode pops , spikes originating from a momentary change in the impedance of a given electrode. Poor grounding of the EEG electrodes can cause significant 50 or 60\u00a0Hz artifact, depending on the local power system's frequency . A third source of possible interference can be the presence of an IV drip ; such devices can cause rhythmic, fast, low-voltage bursts, which may be confused for spikes. Artifact correction [ edit ] Recently, independent component analysis (ICA) techniques have been used to correct or remove EEG contaminants. [64] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] These techniques attempt to \"unmix\" the EEG signals into some number of underlying components. There are many source separation algorithms, often assuming various behaviors or natures of EEG. Regardless, the principle behind any particular method usually allow \"remixing\" only those components that would result in \"clean\" EEG by nullifying (zeroing) the weight of unwanted components. Fully automated artifact rejection methods, which use ICA, have also been developed. [72] In the last few years, by comparing data from paralysed and unparalysed subjects, EEG contamination by muscle has been shown to be far more prevalent than had previously been realized, particularly in the gamma range above 20\u00a0Hz. [73] However, Surface Laplacian has been shown to be effective in eliminating muscle artefact, particularly for central electrodes, which are further from the strongest contaminants. [74] The combination of Surface Laplacian with automated techniques for removing muscle components using ICA proved particularly effective in a follow up study. [75] Abnormal activity [ edit ] Abnormal activity can broadly be separated into epileptiform and non-epileptiform activity. It can also be separated into focal or diffuse. Focal epileptiform discharges represent fast, synchronous potentials in a large number of neurons in a somewhat discrete area of the brain. These can occur as interictal activity, between seizures, and represent an area of cortical irritability that may be predisposed to producing epileptic seizures. Interictal discharges are not wholly reliable for determining whether a patient has epilepsy nor where his/her seizure might originate. (See focal epilepsy .) Generalized epileptiform discharges often have an anterior maximum, but these are seen synchronously throughout the entire brain. They are strongly suggestive of a generalized epilepsy. Focal non-epileptiform abnormal activity may occur over areas of the brain where there is focal damage of the cortex or white matter . It often consists of an increase in slow frequency rhythms and/or a loss of normal higher frequency rhythms. It may also appear as focal or unilateral decrease in amplitude of the EEG signal. Diffuse non-epileptiform abnormal activity may manifest as diffuse abnormally slow rhythms or bilateral slowing of normal rhythms, such as the PBR. Intracortical Encephalogram electrodes and sub-dural electrodes can be used in tandem to discriminate and discretize artifact from epileptiform and other severe neurological events. More advanced measures of abnormal EEG signals have also recently received attention as possible biomarkers for different disorders such as Alzheimer's disease . [76] Remote communication [ edit ] The United States Army Research Office budgeted $4\u00a0million in 2009 to researchers at the University of California, Irvine to develop EEG processing techniques to identify correlates of imagined speech and intended direction to enable soldiers on the battlefield to communicate via computer-mediated reconstruction of team members' EEG signals, in the form of understandable signals such as words. [77] Economics [ edit ] Inexpensive EEG devices exist for the low-cost research and consumer markets. Recently, a few companies have miniaturized medical grade EEG technology to create versions accessible to the general public. Some of these companies have built commercial EEG devices retailing for less than $100 USD. In 2004 OpenEEG released its ModularEEG as open source hardware. Compatible open source software includes a game for balancing a ball. In 2007 NeuroSky released the first affordable consumer based EEG along with the game NeuroBoy. This was also the first large scale EEG device to use dry sensor technology. [78] In 2008 OCZ Technology developed device for use in video games relying primarily on electromyography . In 2008 the Final Fantasy developer Square Enix announced that it was partnering with NeuroSky to create a game, Judecca. [79] [80] In 2009 Mattel partnered with NeuroSky to release the Mindflex , a game that used an EEG to steer a ball through an obstacle course. By far the best selling consumer based EEG to date. [79] [81] In 2009 Uncle Milton Industries partnered with NeuroSky to release the Star Wars Force Trainer , a game designed to create the illusion of possessing The Force . [79] [82] In 2009 Emotiv released the EPOC, a 14 channel EEG device. The EPOC is the first commercial BCI to not use dry sensor technology, requiring users to apply a saline solution to electrode pads (which need remoistening after an hour or two of use). [83] In 2010, NeuroSky added a blink and electromyography function to the MindSet. [84] In 2011, NeuroSky released the MindWave, an EEG device designed for educational purposes and games. [85] [86] The MindWave won the Guinness Book of World Records award for \"Heaviest machine moved using a brain control interface\". [87] In 2012, a Japanese gadget project, neurowear , released Necomimi: a headset with motorized cat ears. The headset is a NeuroSky MindWave unit with two motors on the headband where a cat's ears might be. Slipcovers shaped like cat ears sit over the motors so that as the device registers emotional states the ears move to relate. For example, when relaxed, the ears fall to the sides and perk up when excited again. In 2014, OpenBCI released an eponymous open source brain-computer interface after a successful kickstarter campaign in 2013. The basic OpenBCI has 8 channels, expandable to 16, and supports EEG, EKG , and EMG . The OpenBCI is based on the Texas Instruments ADS1299 IC and the Arduino or PIC microcontroller, and costs $399 for the basic version. It uses standard metal cup electrodes and conductive paste. In 2015, Mind Solutions Inc released the smallest consumer BCI to date, the NeuroSync. This device functions as a dry sensor at a size no larger than a Bluetooth ear piece. [88] In 2015, A Chinese-based company Macrotellect released BrainLink Pro and BrainLink Lite, a consumer grade EEG wearable product providing 20 brain fitness enhancement Apps on Apple and Android App Stores. [89] Future research [ edit ] This section relies too much on references to primary sources . Please improve this section by adding secondary or tertiary sources . (May 2012) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) The EEG has been used for many purposes besides the conventional uses of clinical diagnosis and conventional cognitive neuroscience. An early use was during World War II by the U.S. Army Air Corps to screen out pilots in danger of having seizures; [90] long-term EEG recordings in epilepsy patients are still used today for seizure prediction . Neurofeedback remains an important extension, and in its most advanced form is also attempted as the basis of brain computer interfaces . The EEG is also used quite extensively in the field of neuromarketing . In recent years, researchers have relied on EEG to understand the neural basis of swallowing . [91] The EEG is altered by drugs that affect brain functions, the chemicals that are the basis for psychopharmacology . Berger's early experiments recorded the effects of drugs on EEG. The science of pharmaco-electroencephalography has developed methods to identify substances that systematically alter brain functions for therapeutic and recreational use. Honda is attempting to develop a system to enable an operator to control its Asimo robot using EEG, a technology it eventually hopes to incorporate into its automobiles. [92] EEGs have been used as evidence in criminal trials in the Indian state of Maharashtra . [93] [94] A lot of research is currently being carried out in order to make EEG devices smaller, more portable and easier to use. So called \"Wearable EEG\" is based upon creating low power wireless collection electronics and \u2018dry\u2019 electrodes which do not require a conductive gel to be used. [95] Wearable EEG aims to provide small EEG devices which are present only on the head and which can record EEG for days, weeks, or months at a time, as ear-EEG . Such prolonged and easy-to-use monitoring could make a step change in the diagnosis of chronic conditions such as epilepsy, and greatly improve the end-user acceptance of BCI systems. [96] Research is also being carried out on identifying specific solutions to increase the battery lifetime of Wearable EEG devices through the use of the data reduction approach. For example, in the context of epilepsy diagnosis, data reduction has been used to extend the battery lifetime of Wearable EEG devices by intelligently selecting, and only transmitting, diagnostically relevant EEG data [97] .

Jeisipsamhoe Donggye Ollimpik ) and commonly known as PyeongChang 2018 , was an international winter multi-sport event that was held between 9 and 25 February 2018 in Pyeongchang County , Gangwon Province , South Korea , with the opening rounds for certain events held on 8 February 2018, the eve of the opening ceremony . Pyeongchang was elected as the host city in July 2011, during the 123rd IOC Session in Durban , South Africa . This was the first time that South Korea had hosted the Winter Olympics and the second Olympics held in the country overall, after the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. It was the third time that an East Asian country had hosted the Winter Games, after Sapporo ( 1972 ) and Nagano ( 1998 ), both in Japan. It was also the first of three consecutive Olympics to be held in East Asia , the other two being the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo and the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. The Games featured 102 events in fifteen sports, with the addition of \"big air\" snowboarding , mass start speed skating , mixed doubles curling , and mixed team alpine skiing to the Winter Olympic programme. 2,914 athletes from 92 NOCs competed, including the debuts of Ecuador , Eritrea , Kosovo , Malaysia , Nigeria and Singapore . After a state-sponsored doping program was exposed following the 2014 Winter Olympics, the Russian Olympic Committee was suspended, and selected athletes were allowed to compete neutrally under the IOC designation of \" Olympic Athletes from Russia \". Despite tense relations , North Korea agreed to participate in the Games, enter with South Korea during the opening ceremony as a unified Korea , and field a unified team in women's ice hockey . Norway led the total medal tally with 39, followed by Germany's 31 and Canada's 29 . [3] Germany and Norway were tied for the most gold medals won; both won fourteen golds. Host nation South Korea won seventeen medals, their highest medal haul at a Winter Olympics, five of which were gold.

[4] Munich also launched a bid to host these Games. Prior to Beijing 's successful 2022 Winter Olympics bid , Munich would have become the first city to host both the Winter and the Summer Games, having previously hosted the 1972 Summer Olympics , but received only 25 votes. Annecy (in southeastern France) launched their own bid, which failed to secure public support from the local citizens. Their bid ended up receiving seven votes. [5] Pyeongchang was elected as the host city at the 123rd IOC Session in Durban in 2011, earning the necessary majority of at least 48 votes in just one round of voting, more votes than its competitors combined. With this, Pyeongchang became the third Asian city to host the Winter Games; the first two were in Japan , at Sapporo ( 1972 ) and Nagano ( 1998 ).

[8] [9] On 4 October 2011, it was announced that the Organizing Committee for the 2018 Winter Olympics would be headed by Kim Jin-sun . The Pyeongchang Organizing Committee for the 2018 Olympic & Paralympic Winter Games (POCOG) was launched at its inaugural assembly on 19 October 2011. The first tasks of the organizing committee were putting together a master plan for the Games as well as forming a design for the venues. [10] The IOC Coordination Commission for the 2018 Winter Olympics made their first visit to Pyeongchang in March 2012. By then, construction was already underway on the Olympic Village. [11] [12] In June 2012, construction began on a high-speed rail line that would connect Pyeongchang to Seoul . [13] The International Paralympic Committee met for an orientation with the Pyeongchang 2018 organizing committee in July 2012. [14] Then-IOC President Jacques Rogge visited Pyeongchang for the first time in February 2013. [15] The Pyeongchang Organizing Committee for the 2018 Olympic & Paralympic Winter Games created Pyeongchang WINNERS in 2014 by recruiting university students living in South Korea to spread awareness of the Olympic Games through social networking services and news articles. [16] 2018 Olympics gold medal 2018 Winter Olympics torch Medals [ edit ] The Games' medal designs were unveiled on 21 September 2017. Designed by Lee Suk-woo, they feature a pattern of diagonal ridges on both sides, with the front including the Olympic rings, and the obverse featuring the Games' emblem, the event name and the discipline. The edge of the medals features extrusions of hangul alphabets, while the ribbons are made from a traditional South Korean textile. [17] Torch relay [ edit ] Main article: 2018 Winter Olympics torch relay The torch relay started on 24 October 2017 in Greece and ended at the start of the Olympics on 9 February 2018. On 1 November 2017 the relay entered Korea. The relay lasted 101 days. There were 7,500 torch bearers to represent the Korean population of 75\u00a0million people. There were also 2,018 support runners to guard the torch and act as messengers. The torch and its bearers traveled by a diverse means of transportation, including by turtle ship in Hansando Island, sailboat on the Baengmagang River in Buyeo , marine cable car in Yeosu , zip-wire over Bamseom Island, steam train in the Gokseong Train Village, marine rail bike along the east coast in Samcheok , and by yacht in Busan Metropolitan City. There were also robot torch relays in Jeju and Daejeon . [18] Venues [ edit ] Olympic venues 2018 Main article: Venues of the 2018 Winter Olympics and Paralympics Dragon Valley (Alpensia) Ski Resort Most of the outdoor snow events were held in the county of Pyeongchang , while the downhill, combined and super-G events in the Alpine skiing were held in the neighboring county of Jeongseon . The indoor ice events were held in Pyeongchang's neighboring city of Gangneung . Pyeongchang (mountain cluster) [ edit ] The Alpensia Sports Park in Daegwallyeong-myeon , Pyeongchang, was the focus of the 2018 Winter Olympics. [19] [20] It was home to the Olympic Stadium , [21] the Olympic Village and most of the outdoor sports venues. Alpensia Ski Jumping Centre \u2013 ski jumping, Nordic combined, snowboarding (big air) Alpensia Biathlon Centre \u2013 biathlon Alpensia Cross-Country Skiing Centre \u2013 cross-country skiing, Nordic combined Alpensia Sliding Centre \u2013 luge, bobsleigh, skeleton Yongpyong Alpine Centre \u2013 alpine skiing (slalom, giant slalom) Additionally, a stand-alone outdoor sports venue was located in Bongpyeong-myeon , Pyeongchang: Phoenix Snow Park \u2013 freestyle skiing, snowboarding Another stand-alone outdoor sports venue was located in Pyeongchang's neighboring county of Jeongseon : Jeongseon Alpine Centre \u2013 alpine skiing (downhill, super-G, combined) Gangneung (coastal cluster) [ edit ] The Gangneung Olympic Park in the city of Gangneung includes four indoor sports venues, all in close proximity to one another. Gangneung Hockey Centre \u2013 ice hockey (men's competition) Gangneung Curling Centre \u2013 curling Gangneung Oval [21] \u2013 long track speed skating Gangneung Ice Arena \u2013 short track speed skating, figure skating Additionally, a stand-alone indoor sports venue was located in the grounds of Catholic Kwandong University . Kwandong Hockey Centre \u2013 ice hockey (women's competition) Ticketing [ edit ] Ticket prices for the 2018 Winter Olympics were announced in April 2016 and tickets went on sale in October 2016. Event tickets ranged in price from \u20a9 20,000 (approx. US$ 17) to \u20a9900,000 (~US$776) while tickets for the opening and closing ceremonies ranged from \u20a9220,000 (~US$190) to \u20a91.5\u00a0million (~US$1293). The exact prices were determined through market research; around 50% of the tickets were expected to cost about \u20a980,000 (~US$69) or less, and tickets in sports that are relatively unknown in the region, such as biathlon and luge, were made cheaper in order to encourage attendance. By contrast, figure skating and the men's ice hockey gold-medal game carried the most expensive tickets of the Games. [22] As of 11 October 2017, domestic ticket sales for the Games were reported to be slow. Of the 750,000 seats allocated to South Koreans, only 20.7% had been sold. International sales were more favorable, with 59.7% of the 320,000 allocated tickets sold. [23] [24] However, as of 31 January 2018, 77% of all tickets had been sold. [25] The Games [ edit ] Parade of Nations at 2018 Olympic Opening Ceremony Opening ceremony [ edit ] Main article: 2018 Winter Olympics opening ceremony The opening ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympics was held at the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium on 9 February 2018; the US$100\u00a0million facility was only intended to be used for the opening and closing ceremonies of these Olympics and the subsequent Paralympics , and is scheduled to be demolished following their conclusion. [26] Sports [ edit ] The 2018 Winter Olympics featured 102 events in 15 sports, [27] making it the first Winter Olympics to surpass 100 medal events. Six new events in existing sports were introduced to the Winter Olympic program in Pyeongchang, including men's and ladies' big air snowboarding, mixed doubles curling , men's and ladies' mass start speed skating, and mixed team alpine skiing. [28] [27] Alpine skiing (11) ( details ) Biathlon (11) ( details ) Bobsleigh (3) ( details ) Cross-country skiing (12) ( details ) Curling (3) ( details ) Figure skating (5) ( details ) Freestyle skiing (10) ( details ) Ice hockey (2) ( details ) Luge (4) ( details ) Nordic combined (3) ( details ) Short track speed skating (8) ( details ) Skeleton (2) ( details ) Ski jumping (4) ( details ) Snowboarding (10) ( details ) Speed skating (14) ( details ) Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of medal events contested in each sport. Participating National Olympic Committees [ edit ] A total of 92 teams qualified at least one athlete to compete in the Games. The number of athletes who qualified per country is listed in the table below (number of athletes shown in parentheses). Six nations made their Winter Olympics debut: Ecuador, Eritrea, Kosovo, Malaysia, Nigeria and Singapore. [29] [30] Athletes from three further countries \u2013 the Cayman Islands, Dominica and Peru \u2013 qualified to compete, but all three National Olympic Committees returned the quota spots back to the International Ski Federation (FIS). [31] Under an historic agreement facilitated by the IOC, qualified athletes from North Korea were allowed to cross the Korean Demilitarized Zone into South Korea to compete in the Games. [32] [33] [34] The two nations marched together under the Korean Unification Flag during the opening ceremony. [35] [36] A unified Korean team , consisting of 12 players from North Korea and 23 from South Korea, competed in the women's ice hockey tournament under a special IOC country code designation (COR) following talks in Panmunjom on 17 January 2018. [37] The two nations also participated separately: the South Korea team competed in every sport and the North Korea team competed in alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, figure skating and short track speed skating. [38] See North Korea at the 2018 Winter Olympics for further details. On 5 December 2017, the IOC announced that the Russian Olympic Committee had been suspended due to the Russian doping controversy and the investigation into the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Individual Russian athletes, who qualified and could demonstrate they had complied with the IOC's doping regulations, were given the option to compete at the 2018 Games as \" Olympic Athletes from Russia \" (OAR) under the Olympic flag and with the Olympic anthem played at any ceremony.

Event scheduling [ edit ] To accommodate primetime broadcasts in the Americas , figure skating events were scheduled with morning start times; figure skating in particular has typically been one of the most popular Winter Olympic sports among U.S. viewers. This scheduling practice had an impact on the events themselves, including skaters having to adjust to the modified schedule, as well as the attendance levels of the sessions themselves. [46] Conversely, and somewhat controversially, eight of the eleven biathlon events were scheduled at night, making it necessary for competitors to ski and shoot under floodlights, with colder temperatures and blustery winds.

[52] The previous record of seven Winter Olympics was held by Russian luger Albert Demchenko . American Nathan Chen became the first figure skater to land five quadruple jumps in one program. [53] German figure skaters Aliona Savchenko and Bruno Massot set a new ISU best free skating score of 159.31 in pair skating . [54] Canadian figure skaters Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir set a new ISU best short dance score of 83.67 [55] and a new ISU best combined total score of 206.07 [56] in ice dance . French ice dancers Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron set a new ISU best free dance score of 123.35. [57] Russian figure skater Alina Zagitova set a new ISU best short program score of 82.92 in Ladies' single skating . [58] Dutch speed skater Sven Kramer won gold in the men's 5000m event, becoming the only male speed skater to win the same Olympic event three times . He was also the first man to win a total of eight Olympic medals in speed skating. [59] Dutch speed skater Ireen W\u00fcst won an individual gold medal for the fourth Olympics in a row, the first time this had been achieved by a Winter Olympian. She also became the first speed skater (male or female) to win ten Winter Olympic medals and the first female Winter Olympian to win nine individual medals . [60] Chinese short track speed skater Wu Dajing beat the men's 500m world record twice en route to winning a gold medal, becoming only the second person in history to skate the discipline in under 40 seconds (after American J. R. Celski), and the first to achieve this at \"sea level\". [61] Dutch athlete Jorien ter Mors became the first female athlete to win Olympic medals in two different sports at a single Winter Games ; [62] she won a speed skating gold medal in the 1000 metres and she was also part of the Dutch short track team that won bronze in the 3000 metre relay . Ester Ledeck\u00e1 of the Czech Republic won gold in the skiing super-G event and another gold in the snowboarding parallel giant slalom , making her the first female athlete to win Olympic gold medals in two different sports at a single Winter Games . [63] Norwegian cross-country skier Marit Bj\u00f8rgen won bronze in the women's team sprint and gold in the 30 kilometre classical event , bringing her total Olympic medal haul to fifteen, the most won by any athlete (male or female) in Winter Olympics history. [64] The record was previously held by fellow Norwegian athlete Ole Einar Bj\u00f8rndalen who has thirteen Olympic medals. Germany and Canada tied for gold in the two-man bobsleigh event, only the second time in history that two countries had tied for a gold medal in this particular event, the first time being in the 1998 Winter Olympics twenty years earlier. [65] Norway won a total of 39 medals, setting a new record for the highest number of medals won at a single Winter Olympics. Their 39th medal was the gold won by cross-country skier Marit Bj\u00f8rgen in the 30\u00a0km classical event. The record was previously held by the USA who won 37 medals in Vancouver in 2010. [66] Olympic cauldron in Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium Closing ceremony [ edit ] Main article: 2018 Winter Olympics closing ceremony The closing ceremony of the 2018 Winter Olympics was held at the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium on 25 February 2018, as Thomas Bach , the IOC president, declared the Games closed, and the cauldron extinguished. Broadcasting [ edit ] Main article: List of 2018 Winter Olympics broadcasters Broadcast rights to the 2018 Winter Olympics in some countries were already sold as part of long-term broadcast rights deals, including the Games' local rightsholder SBS , which in July 2011 had extended its rights to the Olympics through to 2024. [67] SBS sub-licensed its rights to MBC and KBS . [68] On 29 June 2015, the IOC announced that Discovery Communications had acquired exclusive rights to the Olympics across all of Europe outside of Russia, from 2018 through to 2024. Discovery's pan-European Eurosport networks were promoted as the main rightsholder of the Games, but Discovery free-to-air channels such as DMAX in Spain, [69] Kanal 5 in Sweden and TVNorge in Norway, were also involved. [70] Discovery was required to sub-licence at least 100 hours of coverage to free-to-air broadcasters in each market; [71] [72] [73] some of these agreements required certain sports to be exclusive to Eurosport and its affiliated networks. [74] [74] The deal did not initially cover France due to France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions ' rights, which run through to the 2020 Games. [75] In the United Kingdom, Discovery held exclusive pay television rights under license from the BBC , in return for BBC sub-licencing the free-to-air rights to the 2022 and 2024 Olympics from Discovery. [76] Despite the Russian team being formally banned from competing under its flag in Pyeongchang, Russian state broadcaster Channel One , and sports channel Match TV , still committed to covering the Games with a focus on Russian athletes. [75] Russia was not affected by the Eurosport deal, due to a pre-existing contract held by a marketing agency which runs through to 2024. [75] In the United States, the Games were once again broadcast by NBCUniversal properties under a long-term contract. [77] [78] As U.S. Eastern Time is fourteen hours behind Pyeongchang, morning events naturally fell within traditional U.S. prime time hours (8:00 to 11:00\u00a0pm). This allowed NBC to broadcast its prime time coverage live in all U.S. time zones, rather than showing \"plausibly live\" delayed footage as they had in previous Olympics. As per previous Games, the ceremonies were still shown on TV via tape delay only, but NBC did, for the first time, offer live streaming of the opening ceremony online. [79] [80] Notably, figure skating events were deliberately scheduled for the morning in Pyeongchang to accommodate the network\u2019s live broadcast to a peak U.S. audience in the evening. [46] NHK and Olympic Broadcasting Services (OBS) once again filmed portions of the Games, including 90 hours of footage of selected events and the opening ceremonies, in high-dynamic-range 8K resolution video. [81] [82] In South Korea, ATSC 3.0 digital terrestrial television at 4K resolution was introduced in 2017 in time for the Olympics. [83] [84] In the U.S., this footage was delivered in 4K by NBCUniversal parent Comcast to participating television providers, including its own Xfinity , as well as DirecTV and Dish Network . NBC's Raleigh, North Carolina affiliate WRAL-TV also held demonstration viewings as part of its ATSC 3.0 test broadcasts. [85] [86] [87] The 2018 Winter Olympics were also used to showcase 5G wireless technologies, as part of a collaboration between domestic wireless sponsor KT , and worldwide sponsor Intel . Several venues were outfitted with 5G networks to facilitate features such as live camera feeds from bobsleds, and multi-camera views from cross-country and figure skating events. These were offered as part of public demonstrations coordinated by KT and Intel. [88] [89] Marketing [ edit ] Branding [ edit ] The emblem for the Games was unveiled on 3 May 2013. It is a stylised representation of the hangul letters \u314d p and \u314a ch , these being the initial sounds of \ud3c9\ucc3d Pyeongchang . The left-hand symbol is said to represent the Korean philosophical triad of heaven, earth and humanity ( Korean : \ucc9c\uc9c0\uc778 cheon-ji-in ), and the right-hand symbol represents a crystal of ice. [90] In the emblem and all official materials, Pyeongchang was stylised in CamelCase as \"PyeongChang\", in order to alleviate potential confusion with Pyongyang , the similarly-named capital of neighbouring North Korea . [91] Soohorang (left) and Bandabi (right), respective mascots of 2018 Winter Olympics and Paralympics. Mascots [ edit ] Main article: Soohorang and Bandabi The official mascots of the 2018 Winter Olympics and Paralympics were unveiled on 2 June 2016. The Olympic mascot, Soohorang ( Korean : \uc218\ud638\ub791), is a white tiger . The mascot's name is a portmanteau of \"Sooho\", a Korean word for \"protection\", and \"Rang\" which is derived both from the Korean word for \"tiger\" and from the name of a traditional Korean folk song originating from Gangwon Province . [92] Tigers have a strong association with Korean culture and folklore . Video games [ edit ] Intel Extreme Masters Season 12 \u2013 Pyeongchang Tournament information Sport StarCraft II Location Pyeongchang , South Korea Administrator(s) Electronic Sports League Final positions Champions Scarlett Runner-up sOs \u2190 Oakland 2017 Katowice 2018 \u2192 In June 2017, Ubisoft announced that it would release an expansion pack for its winter sports video game Steep entitled Road to the Olympics , which features new game modes and content inspired by the 2018 Winter Olympics. [93] [94] In November 2017, the IOC announced it would support and sponsor an Intel Extreme Masters StarCraft II tournament in Pyeongchang preceding the Games. Its support of the tournament as a de facto demonstration event came on the heels of a report by the IOC which recognised that eSports \"could be considered as a sporting activity\". [95] [96] [97] The tournament was won by Sasha \"Scarlett\" Hostyn of Canada; she became the second North American pro to place first at a major StarCraft II tournament in South Korea, and the first woman to win a major tournament. [98] [99] Sponsors [ edit ] The 2018 Winter Olympics saw increasing granularity in official sponsorships for technology vendors; Intel signed with the IOC to become part of its Worldwide Olympic Partner program, to promote 5G wireless technology, as well as broadcasting technology such as 360-degree video and virtual reality . Alibaba Group was also named the official e-commerce and cloud services provider. These categories affected how the vendors were allowed to promote themselves within the context of the Olympics: Samsung could showcase VR experiences but only within the context of its own smartphones due to Intel's sponsorship rights in relation to VR; Alibaba could not promote Alipay due to Visa Inc. sponsorship rights; and Intel could not promote end-user applications of 5G due to national sponsorship rights held by KT Corporation . [100] [101] Concerns and controversies [ edit ] Main article: Concerns and controversies at the 2018 Winter Olympics North Korean relations [ edit ] See also: North Korea\u2013South Korea relations , 2017\u201318 North Korea crisis , and North Korea at the 2018 Winter Olympics Due to the state of relations between North and South Korea, concerns were raised over the security of the 2018 Winter Olympics, especially in the wake of tensions over North Korean missile and nuclear tests . On 20 September 2017, South Korean president Moon Jae-in stated that the country would ensure the security of the Games. [102] The next day, Laura Flessel-Colovic , the French Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports , stated that France would pull out of the Games if the safety of its delegation could not be guaranteed. [103] Protesters at Gwanghwamun Plaza criticising the game's pro-North Korean measures The next day, Austria and Germany raised similar concerns and also threatened to skip the Games. France later reaffirmed its participation. [104] In early December 2017, the United States Ambassador to the United Nations , Nikki Haley , told Fox News that it was an \"open question\" whether the United States was going to participate in the Games, citing security concerns in the region. [105] However, days later the White House Press Secretary , Sarah Huckabee Sanders , stated that the United States would participate. [106] In his New Year's address on 1 January 2018, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un proposed talks in Seoul over the country's participation in the Games, which would be the first high-level talks between the North and South in over two years. Because of the talks, held on 9 January, North Korea agreed to field athletes in Pyeongchang. [107] [108] On 17 January 2018, it was announced that North and South Korea had agreed to field a unified Korean women's ice hockey team at the Games, and to enter together under a Korean Unification Flag during the opening ceremony. [109] [110] These moves were met with opposition in South Korea, including protests and online petitions; critics argued that the government was attempting to use the Olympics to spread pro-North Korean sentiment, and that the unified hockey team would fail. [111] A rap video entitled \"The Regret for Pyeongchang\" (\ud3c9\ucc3d\uc720\uac10), which echoed this criticism and called the event the \" Pyongyang Olympics\", went viral in the country. [112] Japan's foreign affairs minister Tar\u014d K\u014dno warned South Korea to be wary of North Korea's \" charm offensive \", and not to ease its pressure on the country. [109] [113] The South Korean President, Moon Jae-in , at the start of the Olympics shook hands with the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and a prominent figure of the regime, Kim Yo-jong . This marked the first time since the Korean War that a member of the ruling Kim dynasty had visited South Korea. [114] [115] In contrast, U.S. vice president Mike Pence met with Fred Warmbier (father of Otto Warmbier , who had died after being released from captivity in North Korea) and a group of North Korean defectors in Pyeongchang. [116] American officials said that North Korea cancelled a meeting with Pence at the last minute. [117] At the closing ceremony, North Korea sent general Kim Yong-chol as its delegate. His presence was met with hostility from South Korean conservatives, as there were allegations that he had a role in the ROKS Cheonan sinking and other past attacks. The Ministry of Unification stated that \"there is a limitation in pinpointing who was responsible for the incident.\" Although he is subject to sanctions, they did not affect his ability to visit the country for the Games. [118] [119] Russian doping [ edit ] Main articles: Doping in Russia , McLaren Report , Oswald Commission , Russia at the 2014 Winter Olympics \u00a7\u00a0Doping scandal after Olympics , Russia at the 2016 Summer Olympics , and Olympic Athletes from Russia at the 2018 Winter Olympics Russia 's participation in the 2018 Winter Olympics was affected by the aftermath of its state-sponsored doping program . As a result, the IOC suspended the Russian Olympic Committee in December 2017, although Russian athletes whitelisted by the IOC were allowed to compete neutrally under the OAR ( Olympic Athletes from Russia ) designation. [120] The official sanctions imposed by the IOC included: the exclusion of Russian government officials from the Games; the use of the Olympic flag and Olympic Anthem in place of the Russian flag and anthem; and the submission of a replacement logo for the OAR uniforms. [121] By early January 2018, the IOC had banned 43 Russian athletes from competing in the 2018 Winter Olympics and all future Olympic Games (as part of the Oswald Commission ). Of those athletes, 42 appealed against their bans to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and 28 of the appeals were successful, but eleven of the athletes had their sanctions upheld due to the weight of evidence against them. The IOC stated that the court ruling did not prove that the 28 athletes were innocent and that they would not necessarily be invited to the 2018 Games. Three of the athletes who appealed are still awaiting their hearings. [122] The eventual number of neutral Russian athletes that participated at the 2018 Games was 168. These were selected from an original pool of 500 athletes that was put forward for consideration and, in order to receive an invitation to the Games, they were obliged to meet a number of pre-games conditions to rule out any possibility of doping. Russian president Vladimir Putin and other officials had signalled in the past that it would be a humiliation if Russian athletes were not allowed to compete under the Russian flag. [123] However, there were never actually any official plans to boycott the 2018 Games [120] and in late 2017 the Russian government agreed to allow their athletes to compete at the Games as individuals under a neutral designation. [124] [125] Despite this public show of co-operation, there were numerous misgivings voiced by leading Russian politicians, including a statement from Putin himself saying that he believed the United States had used its influence within the IOC to \"orchestrate the doping scandal\". [126] 86% of the Russian population opposed participation at the Olympics under a neutral flag, [127] and many Russian fans attended the Games wearing the Russian colours and chanting \"Russia!\" in unison, in an act of defiance against the ban. [128] The IOC's decision was heavily criticised by Jack Robertson, primary investigator of the Russian doping program on behalf of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), in whose opinion the judgement was commercially and politically motivated. He argued that not only was doping rife amongst Russian athletes but that there was no sign of it being eradicated. [129] The CAS decision to overturn the life bans of 28 Russian athletes and restore their medals was also fiercely criticised, by Olympic officials, IOC president Thomas Bach and whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov 's lawyer. [130] National Hockey League [ edit ] For the first time since 1998, the National Hockey League did not provide accommodations (including a break in the season for all teams during the Olympics) to allow its players to participate in the men's ice hockey tournament. The NHL's decision stemmed from their demands that the IOC cover the cost of insuring the NHL players who participated in the Games. Although the IOC did pay to insure NHL players in Sochi, the commission was unwilling to do so for Pyeongchang, and was concerned that the NHL's demand could set a precedent for other professional sports bodies to follow. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman added that a factor in the decision was that the IOC did not allow the NHL to promote the involvement of its players in the Olympics. [131] [132] [133] The NHL secured the cooperation of the International Ice Hockey Federation and the IOC, who agreed to establish a blacklist forbidding national teams from nominating or accepting players under NHL contract to their Olympic rosters. [134] [135] Other leagues, such as the Swedish Hockey League , did not close during the games, [136] but teams had to accept that some players took part in the games instead of the league.

Census Bureau-designated regions and divisions [ edit ] U.S. Census Bureau Regions and Divisions. The United States Census Bureau defines four statistical regions, with nine divisions. [1] The Census Bureau region definition is \"widely used\u2026 for data collection and analysis,\" [2] and is the most commonly used classification system. [3] [4] [5] Regional divisions used by the United States Census Bureau : [6] Region 1: Northeast Division 1: New England ( Connecticut , Maine , Massachusetts , New Hampshire , Rhode Island , and Vermont ) Division 2: Mid-Atlantic ( New Jersey , New York , and Pennsylvania ) Region 2: Midwest (Prior to June 1984, the Midwest Region was designated as the North Central Region.) [6] Division 3: East North Central ( Illinois , Indiana , Michigan , Ohio , and Wisconsin ) Division 4: West North Central ( Iowa , Kansas , Minnesota , Missouri , Nebraska , North Dakota , and South Dakota ) Region 3: South Division 5: South Atlantic ( Delaware , Florida , Georgia , Maryland , North Carolina , South Carolina , Virginia , District of Columbia , and West Virginia ) Division 6: East South Central ( Alabama , Kentucky , Mississippi , and Tennessee ) Division 7: West South Central ( Arkansas , Louisiana , Oklahoma , and Texas ) Region 4: West Division 8: Mountain ( Arizona , Colorado , Idaho , Montana , Nevada , New Mexico , Utah , and Wyoming ) Division 9: Pacific ( Alaska , California , Hawaii , Oregon , and Washington ) Puerto Rico and other US territories are not part of any census region or census division. [7] Standard federal regions [ edit ] Standard federal regions. The ten standard federal regions were established by OMB ( Office of Management and Budget ) Circular A-105, \"Standard Federal Regions,\" in April, 1974, and required for all executive agencies. In recent years, some agencies have tailored their field structures to meet program needs and facilitate interaction with local, state and regional counterparts. However, the OMB must still approve any departures. Region I: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont Region II: New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands Region III: Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia Region IV: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee Region V: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Wisconsin Region VI: Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas Region VII: Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska Region VIII: Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming Region IX: Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands Region X: Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, Washington Federal Reserve banks [ edit ] Federal Reserve districts. The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 divided the country into twelve districts with a central Federal Reserve Bank in each district. These twelve Federal Reserve Banks together form a major part of the Federal Reserve System , the central banking system of the United States. Missouri is the only U.S. state to have two Federal Reserve locations within its borders.

[9] It is used for data collection on refining petroleum and its products. Each PADD is subdivided into refining districts. PADD I: East Coast East Coast: Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida; along with counties in New York east of, north of and including Cayuga , Tompkins , and Chemung ; and counties in Pennsylvania east of and including Bradford , Sullivan , Columbia , Montour , Northumberland , Dauphin and York .

New Mexico: New Mexico PADD IV: Rocky Mountain : Colorado, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, Utah PADD V: West Coast : Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Arizona, Alaska, Hawaii [10] PADD I can also be subdivided into 3 Subdistricts: Sub-PAD 1A: New England (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont) Sub-PAD 1B: Central Atlantic (Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, District of Columbia) Sub-PAD 1C: Lower Atlantic (Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia) [11] PADD system was established in World War II and therefore don't accurately reflect current trends. The EIA has updated the PADD system with a complimentary set of regions to reflect this and will change it to suite current needs.

Contents [ hide ] 1 Novel series 2 TV series 2.1 Characterization 2.2 Season 1 2.3 Season 2 2.4 Season 3 2.5 Season 4 2.6 Season 5 2.7 Season 6 3 Reception 4 References Novel series [ edit ] Erik is described as similar to every van der Woodsen: tall, thin, and blonde. The older brother of Serena van der Woodsen , Erik van der Woodsen is not featured in the books very often. A junior at Brown University , Serena has said he has \"at least six or seven different girlfriends he sleeps with routinely.\" On a trip to Sun Valley , Erik and Serena\u2019s best friend Blair Waldorf dated briefly. Very close to his sister, Erik threw her a giant sweet sixteenth birthday bash and drove her up to Hanover on her first day of school there. Aside from his brief appearances, Erik remained a relatively quiet secondary character throughout the series, however he did have a bigger part in the Gossip Girl prequel, Gossip Girl: It Had to Be You . TV series [ edit ] Characterization [ edit ] In contrast to the novels, Eric's character is more complex in the show, showing a mature understanding of family and relationships but faces the same troubles as most teenagers have. Alessandra Stanley of The New York Times mentions his character's deviation from the novels from \"an object of female lust\" to one of \"...psychotherapy.\" But notes his strong bond with Serena, stating how he \"is misunderstood by all but his caring, if troubled, sister.\" [1] Despite his mature persona, Eric is no stranger to the problems that most teens face as his stay at the Ostroff Center, a rehabilitation facility, is a result of his constant loneliness and his mother's many unstable marriages. Connor Paolo notes that Eric's lack of a father figure contributed to his suicide attempt. [2] Season 1 [ edit ] At the beginning of the season, Eric has been living at the Ostroff Center, a high-class mental facility. Serena frequently visits him after coming back. As well as trying to convince the doctors and her mother Lilly to let him out. They let Eric out temporarily, during the Ivy League Mixer, where he develops a friendship with Jenny Humphrey . After Blair Waldorf humiliates his sister, telling the whole school she was attending the Ostroff Center during her absence having mistakenly seeing photos of Serena entering the center, Eric tells Blair he was the one attending the mental center and shows her the scars on his wrists from his suicide attempt. At Blair's annual sleepover, Blair dares Jenny to break into the Ostroff Center and take Eric out for the night. Jenny and Blair succeed and they take him to a bar downtown. Lily is made aware of his disappearance and begins to panic. She quickly informs Rufus , whose son, Dan , is on a date with Serena, after she cannot get hold of her. They contact the couple to make sure Eric is alright and to bring him home. Later, Lily realizes that Eric is ready to come out of the medical center. He is present during Thanksgiving dinner at the Humphrey's apartment when Lily and Rufus reveal they had a previous relationship years ago. Due to his mother's engagement to billionaire Bart Bass , he develops a close friendship with Chuck Bass , whom he soon sees as a brother. He tries to warn Jenny about her new boyfriend Asher Hornsby ( Jesse Swenson ) but she mistakes this for Eric being in love with her. In the same episode, Dan and Georgina Sparks see Asher making out with someone outside of school. The news becomes public on Gossip Girl, and Jenny denies the rumor by saying she lost her virginity to Asher, which Eric knows is untrue. During a dinner with his family, Georgina outs him to back at Serena. Eric's homosexuality upsets Lily, who blames herself for Eric getting institutionalized. Serena comforts him, and learns that Eric already came out to Chuck before her because he knew Chuck wouldn't judge him. He also explains that he had a relationship with someone while at the Ostroff Center, but now believed that it was over. At Asher and Jenny's party, Eric helps Blair dethrone Jenny by revealing that Asher was indeed gay , and that they were involved. Asher denies this, but Blair sends a Gossip Girl blast with Eric and Asher's emails. He and Lilly later reconcile. Season 2 [ edit ] During summer 2008, Eric is staying with his sister and grandmother in The Hamptons. He receives a call from Jenny who tells him, she needs help to get in the Vitamin White Party. She apologizes to him about the incident with Asher and they become friends again. Eric introduces Tinsley Mortimer to Jenny to extend her contacts in the fashion industry. After the school year starts, although Serena complains about Lily's new marriage and their new house rules, Eric thinks they should give the marriage a chance. Later, Eric introduces Jonathan Whitney ( Matt Doyle ) as his new boyfriend. They break up after Bart tells Eric that Jonathan has been cheating on him. Eric lodges Jenny secretly in the Bass-van der Woodsen penthouse and goes with her to make the paperwork to divorce her parents. Eric then discovers that Bart hired his private detective, Andrew Tyler, to do research about his, Lily's, and Serena's past. He discovers that Lily was also institutionalized at a French sanatorium and that she didn't tell him so that she could be strong for him. Bart's actions convince Lily to celebrate Thanksgiving with the Humphreys. After Bart's death, Eric comes back with Jonathan and tries to convince Chuck to go back to their penthouse. Chuck and Eric officially go from close friends to brothers after Lily adopts her late husband's son. Season 3 [ edit ] During summer 2009, Eric is in his grandmother's house with Jenny, Dan, and Rufus while Lily is in Montecito taking care of his and Serena's grandmother, CeCe. He observes Jenny's speech to the rest of Constance that end the school hierarchy. During Jenny's gradual transformation as an Upper East Side Queen, he falls victim to Jenny and her cronies when a battle over the steps that Jonathan inadvertently started and ends with Eric being splattered with yogurt. The Halloween party that followed after had Jonathan being egged at the club opening, enraging Eric, who tells Jenny he wants nothing to do with her. Eric sabotages Jenny's Cotillion by falsely sending a text to Graham Collins, the date Jenny wants using her phone which claims that Jonathan will be taking her to Cotillion. He joins forces with Blair, whom Jenny also offends publicly, in making Kira Abernathy, a Constance student whom Jenny regularly ignores, a threat to Jenny's reign as Queen. Blair gives Kira a makeover and Eric blackmails Graham into becoming Kira's escort instead of Jenny. Jenny soon endures public humiliation but manages to gain their respect by taking Nate as her escort for Cotillion. These events cause Jonathan to break up with Eric as he claims Eric has changed now that he's resorted to scheming with Blair. After Cotillion, Jenny leaves with the other Upper East Side Queen Bees and leaves unaware that Eric has been responsible for her public embarrassment. At Thanksgiving, Jenny discovers that Eric was the one behind her public embarrassment at Cotillion which sets her getting her revenge on him. Eric teams up with Kira and attempts to ruin Jenny by buying one of his accomplices the same bag as her and have the girls turn against her. This fails as Jenny reveals two identical bags handing them over to his accomplices, falsely apologizing for her actions but claiming that one of the girls whom Erica bought a bag for spoiled her surprise. Eric and Jenny then to a truce after Serena's car accident. It is revealed in \"Inglourious Bassterds\" that Eric was in Japan and ends up meeting a potential love-interest named Elliot (Luke Kleintank) during a game of assassin on Nate's birthday. [3] On the day of Blair's maid's, Dorota, wedding, Eric wonders if Elliot is gay and discovers that he has a girlfriend during the wedding reception. Elliot then confides in Eric that he is bisexual , indicating that Eric still has a chance with him when Elliot tells him that his girlfriend left out of jealousy. [4] Eric's relationship with his father, William, is also observed when he coldly rejects him for not being there for him. [2] He informs him that he is gay and had been institutionalized. His friendship with Jenny is once again tested when she reveals that she aided his father's escape from the police. He coldly states that no one is forcing Jenny to stay and that she can leave if she wants to. Eric is the first to discover that Jenny lost her virginity to Chuck and tries to comfort a dismayed Jenny, who is sent away to finish high school in Hudson . Season 4 [ edit ] In \" The Undergraduates \", Chuck tries to make amends with Rufus and Eric, by coming to Fashion Week with his new girlfriend, Eva. Eric, however, informs Rufus of Chuck's season 1 assault on Jenny and says that his brother has been given too many chances to redeem himself, signaling the end of their once-close bond. When Jenny returns to the Upper East Side briefly for an interview with Tim Gunn, Eric attempts to help her make a good impression and keep her away from both Chuck and Blair. Later, he and Dan scheme against Blair and Chuck to get Jenny to come back for their parents' anniversary. The plan fails when Blair and Chuck sign a treaty and come to a truce. After Dan steals the treaty from Nate, Eric backs out of the plan. Eric unknowingly leads his parents to Blair's party where Dan's plan is about to go through, thinking Dan had abandoned the plan. Eric is present when Serena is admitted to the Ostroff Center. He is proud of her for going, but does not believe her when she denies overdosing. He is also present when Serena confronts Lily. Pepe angry at his mother for what happened to Ben Donovan and Bass Industries. When man from the Empire calls saying the judge from Ben's case was there, Eric calls Serena, which makes her determined to take Lily down. In \"Damien Darko\", it is revealed that Eric and Elliot broke up and he has been lying to his mother about being with Elliot when he has really been with Damien. When Jonathan goes with Eric to the W party, Eric ditches Jonathan to meet up with Damien. However, earlier Ben had seen Eric with Damien and called Serena. When they walk in on Eric and Damien, the two pretend to be couple and Ben lectures Eric about making bad choices. Eric promises not to see Damien anymore. Rufus confronts Eric, asking if he bought drugs from Damien and Eric says he bought some pills, but realizes it was stupid and promises to stop. But while he keeps that promise, when Damien calls Eric after Ben warns him away from Serena's family, Eric agrees to hang out with him. Season 5 [ edit ] Rufus reveals in the season 5 premiere \" Yes, Then Zero \" that Jenny and Eric have moved to London to attend Saint Martins. During the episode \"Memoirs of an Invisible Dan\", it's mentioned that in Dan's semi-autobiographical novel Inside Nate and Eric's literary counterparts were meshed together. Season 6 [ edit ] Eric returns briefly for the series finale. Reception [ edit ] TV Line 's Michael Ausiello had reported that Connor Paolo had originally been offered to become a series regular for the show's second season but kindly declined. \u201cI\u2019m very happy with my position on the show and I have no interest in changing it,\u201d and that he may not be ready to face the same challenges as his other castmates stating that \u201cWatching Blake [Lively] and Penn [Badgley] and the things they have to deal with as [a full-time cast members]\u2026 because they are on the posters and they are the face of the show, is not something I\u2019m totally ready for right now.\u201d References [ edit ] Jump up ^ Stanley, Alessandra (11 March 2011). \"Reading, Writing and Raunch: Mean Girls Rule Prep School\" .

Inspired by William Shakespeare 's play Twelfth Night , it is a remake of the 1985 film Just One of the Guys . The film centers on teenager Viola Hastings who enters her brother's school in his place, pretending to be a boy, in order to play with the boys' soccer team after her team gets cut at her school. Contents [ hide ] 1 Plot 2 Cast 3 Reception 3.1 Box office 3.2 Critical response 4 See also 5 References 6 External links Plot [ edit ] Viola Hastings ( Amanda Bynes ) is a teen girl who plays for Cornwall College\u2019s soccer team until the team gets cut. Meanwhile, her twin brother, Sebastian (James Kirk), is supposed to enroll in Illyria, an elite boarding school, but he secretly goes to London with his fledgling band instead. Viola agrees to cover for him and decides to pass herself off as Sebastian, in hopes of joining their boys' team and beating Cornwall to prove their coach and her cocky ex-boyfriend, Justin ( Robert Hoffman ), wrong. With the help of her stylist friend, Paul ( Jonathan Sadowski ), she is transformed into \"Sebastian\" and attends Illyria in his place. While moving in, she meets her roommate, Duke Orsino ( Channing Tatum ), an attractive soccer player and Illyria's team captain. During tryouts, Viola fails to impress Coach Dinklage ( Vinnie Jones ) and is assigned to second string, much to her dismay. Her teammates, including Duke, initially dislike \"Sebastian\" due to his awkward and strange behavior. However, with help from Paul once again, they begin to accept him into their social circle. \"Sebastian\" then gets the popular and pretty Olivia ( Laura Ramsey ) as his lab partner, which frustrates Duke, as he has feelings for her. \"Sebastian\" agrees to put in a good word for Duke if he promises to train him to be a better soccer player. Coach Dinklage eventually notices \"Sebastian's\" effort and improvement, thus promoting him to first string. At the Junior League carnival, where her mother has made her volunteer, Viola works a shift at the kissing booth and shares a kiss with Duke. Duke expresses to \"Sebastian\" that he might move on from Olivia as he is starting to like Viola now. Viola is delighted as she secretly feels the same way. Olivia who now has a crush on \"Sebastian\", asks Duke out on a date in hopes that it will make \"Sebastian\" jealous. Viola, who is unaware of Olivia's true intentions, is enraged instead because Duke has now abandoned his interest in Viola. When Viola finds out the truth, she encourages Olivia to tell \"Sebastian\" directly about her feelings. The situation becomes even more complicated when the real Sebastian returns from London a day early, unbeknownst to Viola. As soon as he arrives at Illyria, Olivia confesses her feelings and kisses him. Duke, seeing this, believes his roommate has betrayed him. When \"Sebastian\" returns to their room, the two have an argument and Duke kicks him out. Viola oversleeps and misses the first half of the game, while the real Sebastian is mistaken for \"Sebastian\" and winds up poorly playing his sister's game instead. At half-time , Viola explains the situation to Sebastian and they switch places again. Duke, still furious at \"Sebastian\", refuses to cooperate with him on the field. Determined to makes amends with Duke, \"Sebastian\" explains that he is actually Viola. Illyria wins the game when Viola scores a goal, finally humiliating Justin and the rest of the Cornwall boys. Everyone at Illyria celebrates their victory over Cornwall, except for Duke who is hurt about Viola's deception. Viola introduces Sebastian and Olivia officially, and they begin dating. Viola and Sebastian's divorced parents also make up, exchanging contact information so as to be better parents towards their children. She invites Duke to her debutante ball, with an invitation delivered by Sebastian, now Duke's roommate. Still hurt, Duke doesn't respond to Viola's invitation, which devastates her. At the ball, Viola is skeptical that Duke will show up; she distracts herself by assisting Olivia, who is being escorted by Sebastian to the ball, and is touched when Paul asks to be her date. Her mother shows up with a dress that will suit Viola's \"no ruffles\" policy, but Viola decides to go for a walk instead. She runs into Duke outside, who tells her that he has feelings for her, but that he doesn't want there to be any more deception on her part; Viola promises to be honest with him. Later, Monique is escorted by Justin, Olivia is escorted by Sebastian, and Viola and Duke enter the stage late, but together, with Viola in her new dress, much to the joy of her mother. Viola and Duke share a kiss before joining the crowd. At the end of the film, Viola and Duke are shown happily playing on Illyria's soccer team together.

{"question": "who played booster in jingle all the way", "answer": "", "context": "Jingle All the Way - Wikipedia Jingle All the Way From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search For other uses, see Jingle All the Way (disambiguation) . Jingle All the Way Theatrical release poster Directed by Brian Levant Produced by Chris Columbus Michael Barnathan Mark Radcliffe Written by Randy Kornfield Starring Arnold Schwarzenegger Sinbad Phil Hartman Rita Wilson Jake Lloyd Curtis Armstrong Robert Conrad Jim Belushi Music by David Newman Cinematography Victor J.

The plot focuses on two rival fathers, workaholic Howard Langston (Schwarzenegger) and stressed out postal worker Myron Larabee (Sinbad), both desperately trying to get a Turbo-Man action figure for their respective sons on a last minute shopping spree on Christmas Eve . Inspired by real-life Christmas toy sell-outs for products such as the Cabbage Patch Kids and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers , the film was written by Randy Kornfield. Producer Chris Columbus rewrote the script, adding in elements of satire about the commercialization of Christmas, and the project was picked up by 20th Century Fox . Delays on Fox's reboot of Planet of the Apes allowed Schwarzenegger to come on board the film, while Columbus opted to cast Sinbad ahead of Joe Pesci as Myron. Jingle All the Way was set and filmed in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul at a variety of locations, including the Mall of America . After five weeks filming, production moved to California where scenes such as the end parade were shot. The film's swift production meant merchandising was limited to a replica of the Turbo-Man action figure used in the film. Although some critics felt the film was good family entertainment, it was met with a broadly negative response. Much criticism was attached to the film's script, its focus on the commercialism of Christmas, Levant's direction and Schwarzenegger's performance. Nevertheless, it proved a success at the box office, generating $129 million worldwide, and it receives regular broadcasts on television during the Christmas season. In 2001, Fox was ordered to pay $19 million to Murray Hill Publishing for stealing the idea for the film; the verdict was overturned three years later. Jingle All the Way is also Sinbad and Hartman's third collaboration after Coneheads (1993) and Houseguest (1995).

After missing Jamie's karate class graduation, Howard resolves to redeem himself by fulfilling Jamie's ultimate Christmas wish: getting an action figure toy of Turbo-Man, a wildly popular TV superhero. On Christmas Eve, Howard sets out to buy a Turbo-Man doll at a store, telling Liz that he already has one at work that he must retrieve. Along the way, Howard meets Myron Larabee, a postal worker dad with a rival ambition, and the two soon become bitter competitors in their race for the action figure. During his search, Howard runs his car into the parked police motorcycle of Officer Hummel, who earlier pulled him over and gave him a ticket. After several failed attempts to find the toy in a store, Howard attempts to buy a Turbo-Man from a Mall of America Santa, who is actually the leader of a band of counterfeit toy makers. When he accuses the Santa of undermining the values of Christmas (having been ripped off and sold a defective toy that falls apart the moment he opened the package), Howard ends up in a brawl with the gang. He narrowly escapes when the police raid their warehouse and gets out by posing as an undercover detective using a toy badge. Later, Howard arrives at Mickey's Diner and uses their phone to call home. As he tried to get a hold of Liz, he unintentionally scolds Jamie on the phone over Turbo-Man. Jamie, in turn, rebukes his father about how he never keeps his promises, and hangs up. Liz overhears the argument and becomes disappointed in her husband. Howard then encounters Myron at the diner. As they sat down and talk, Myron tells Howard about the time when his father was unable to get him a Johnny Seven OMA toy on Christmas. They hear on the KQRS radio station that there is a trivia competition in which the winner will receive a Turbo-Man doll. They rush to the studio, with Howard breaking the door to the recording booth, under the impression that the DJ has a Turbo-Man doll in the studio. After Myron threatens to blow up the studio with a package he claims is a mail bomb, he and Howard find out that whoever wins the competition will get a doll \"eventually.\" The package is revealed to be a music box. The police, led by Officer Hummell, arrive in the studio, and Myron bluffs the police into backing off by threatening them with another \"mail bomb,\" allowing him and Howard to escape. Hummell confidently rips open the package and it explodes, leaving his face covered in soot. After his car is stripped by thieves, Howard is ultimately forced to return home empty-handed. Outside his home, he sees Ted in his house placing the star on his tree. In anger, Howard breaks into Ted's house and steals the Turbo-Man doll from under his tree. He realizes that he is stealing from a child and changes his mind. He is attacked by Ted's pet reindeer, accidentally setting one of Ted's decorations on fire, and kicking it out the window trying to stamp it out, drawing the attention of Ted and Liz. Liz, having had enough, leaves with Jamie, Ted, and his son Johnny to the local Christmas parade; Howard follows, aiming to make amends. At the parade, Ted makes a pass at Liz and she hits him with a thermos of eggnog . Howard witnesses Ted's actions from a distance, and on his way to confront him, he runs into Officer Hummel, spilling his hot coffee all over him. Howard runs and Hummell chases him, and Howard enters a room where he is mistaken as the replacement actor for Turbo-Man. As the \"real\" Turbo-Man, he presents the coveted limited-edition Turbo-Man doll to his son. Before he recognizes his father, Jamie is chased by Myron, who has dressed as Turbo-Man's arch enemy Dementor (having caught, tied up and gagged the real actor). As the crowd assumes this is all part of the show, Howard attempts to rescue his son by utilizing the Turbo-Man suit's equipment. Howard catches Jamie as he falls from a roof and reveals himself to his son. Officer Hummell gives the doll to Jamie, then asks Howard (as Turbo-Man) to join the police force, saluting him. Howard turns and reveals himself and Hummell is dumbfounded, as Howard apologizes for all the trouble. Myron is arrested while ranting about having to explain his failure to get the Turbo-Man toy for his son. Jamie decides to give the doll to him, telling Howard that he has \"the real Turbo-Man at home.\" During the after-credits scene, It is snowing outside. Howard puts the star on the top of his tree and celebrates Christmas with Jamie and Liz. Liz commends Howard for everything he's done just to make Jamie happy, and then asks Howard what he got her for Christmas. Howard stares in shock at the camera before the fadeout.

The film draws inspiration from the high demand for Christmas toys such as the Cabbage Patch Kids and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which often led to intense searching and occasional violence amongst shoppers. [3] [4] Randy Kornfield wrote the film's original screenplay after witnessing his in-laws go to a Santa Monica toy store at dawn in order to get his son a Power Ranger. [3] While admitting to missing the clamor for the Cabbage Patch Kids and Power Rangers, producer Chris Columbus experienced a similar situation in 1995 when he attempted to obtain a Buzz Lightyear action figure from the film Toy Story , released that year. As a result, he rewrote Kornfield's script, which was accepted by 20th Century Fox . [4] Columbus was always \"attracted to the dark side of the happiest holiday of the year\", so wrote elements of the film as a satire of the commercialization of Christmas. [5] Brian Levant was hired to direct the film. Columbus said Levant \"underst[ood] the humor in the material\" and \"was very animated and excited, and he had a vision of what he wanted to do\". Levant said \"The story that was important to me was between the father and son...it's a story about love, and a father's journey to deliver it in the form of a Turbo Man doll. The fact that I got to design a toy line and do the commercials and make pajamas and comic books was fun for me as a filmmaker. But at its root, the movie's about something really sweet. It's about love and building a better family. I think that's consistent with everything I've done.\" [6] Arnold Schwarzenegger was quickly cast. [4] He became available in February 1996 after Fox's remake of Planet of the Apes was held up again; [2] Columbus also exited that project to work on Jingle All the Way . [7] The film marks Schwarzenegger's fourth appearance as the lead in a comedy film, following Twins (1988), Kindergarten Cop (1990) and Junior (1994). [8] Schwarzenegger was paid a reported $20 million for the role. [9] He enjoyed the film, having experienced last-minute Christmas shopping himself, [9] and was attracted to playing an \"ordinary\" character in a family film. [10] Columbus initially wanted Joe Pesci to play Myron. [10] Comedian Sinbad was chosen instead, partly due to his similar height and size to Schwarzenegger. [10] Sinbad was suggested for the part by Schwarzenegger's agent, but the producers felt he was unsuited to the role of a villain as it could harm his clean, family-oriented comedy act and reputation, although Sinbad felt the character would generate the audience's sympathy rather than hate. [11] Furthermore, he missed the audition due to his appearance with First Lady Hillary Clinton and musician Sheryl Crow on the USO tour of Bosnia and Herzegovina , [12] but Columbus waited for him to return to allow him to audition and, although Sinbad felt he had \"messed\" it up, he was given the part. [11] He improvised the majority of his lines in the film; [11] Schwarzenegger also improvised many of his responses in his conversations with Sinbad's character. [13] Filming [ edit ] Filming took place in Minnesota for five weeks from April 15, 1996; at the time, it was the largest film production to ever take place in the state. [14] Jingle All the Way was set and filmed in the Twin Cities metropolitan area of Minnesota at locations such as Bloomington 's Mall of America , [1] Mickey's Diner , [15] downtown Minneapolis , Linden Hills , residential areas of Edina and primarily downtown Saint Paul . Unused shops in the Seventh Place Mall area were redecorated to resemble Christmas decorated stores, [14] while the Energy Park Studios were used for much of the filming and the Christmas lights stayed up at Rice Park for use in the film. [16] The Mall of America and the state's \"semi-wintry weather\" proved attractive for the studio. [9] Although Schwarzenegger stated that the locals were \"well-behaved\" and \"cooperative\", Levant often found filming \"impossible\" due to the scale and noise of the crowds who came to watch production, especially in the Mall of America, [9] but overall found the locals to be \"respectful\" and \"lovely people.\" [15] Levant spent several months in the area before filming in order to prepare. The film uses artistic license by treating Minneapolis and Saint Paul as one city, as this was logistically easier; the police are labeled \"Twin Cities Police\" in the film. [15] Additionally, the city's Holidazzle Parade is renamed the Wintertainment Parade and takes place on 2nd Avenue during the day, rather than Nicollet Mall at night. Levant wanted to film the parade at night but was overruled for practical reasons. [15] The parade was filmed at Universal Studios Hollywood in California on the New York Street set, [17] due to safety concerns. The set was designed to resemble 2nd Avenue; the parade was shot from above by helicopters and stitched into matte shots of the real-life street. [15] It took three weeks to film, with 1,500 extras being used in the scene, along with three custom designed floats. [17] Other parts of the film to be shot in Los Angeles, California included store interiors, [16] and the warehouse fight scene between Howard and the criminal Santas, for which a Pasadena furniture warehouse was used. [17] Turbo-Man was created and designed for the film. This meant the commercials and scenes from the Turbo-Man TV series were all shot by Levant, while all of the Turbo-Man merchandise, packaging and props shown in the film were custom made one-offs and designed to look \"authentic, as if they all sprang from the same well.\" [2] Along with Columbus and Levant, production designer Leslie McDonald and character designer Tim Flattery crafted Turbo-Man, Booster and Dementor and helped make the full-size Turbo-Man suit for the film's climax. [17] Principal production finished in August; Columbus \"fine-tun[ed] the picture until the last possible minute,\" using multiple test audiences \"to see where the big laughs actually lie.\" [18] Soundtrack [ edit ] Jingle All the Way Soundtrack album by Various Released 1996 Genre Various Length 36 : 51 Label TVT TVT Records released the film's soundtrack album on Audio CD on November 26, 1996. [19] [20] It features only two of composer David Newman 's pieces from Jingle All the Way , but features many of the songs by other artists included in the film, as well as other Christmas songs and new tracks by the Brian Setzer Orchestra . [21] Intrada Music Group released a Special Collection limited edition of Newman's full 23-track score on November 3, 2008. [22] Track listing [ edit ] No. Title Writer(s) Artist [19] Length 1. \" Jingle Bells \" James Pierpont The Brian Setzer Orchestra 2:18 2. \"So They Say It's Christmas\" Brian Setzer Lou Rawls , The Brian Setzer Orchestra 4:05 3. \" Sleigh Ride \" Leroy Anderson , Mitchell Parish Darlene Love , The Brian Setzer Orchestra 2:36 4. \" Run Rudolph Run \" Marvin Brodie, Johnny Marks Chuck Berry 2:44 5. \" It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year \" Edward Pola , George Wyle Johnny Mathis 2:47 6. \" Merry Christmas Baby \" Lou Baxter, Johnny Moore Charles Brown 4:47 7. \" Back Door Santa \" Clarence Carter, Marcus Daniel Clarence Carter 2:09 8. \" The Christmas Song \" Mel Torm\u00e9 , Robert Wells Nat King Cole 3:10 9. \" Jingle Bell Rock \" Joe Beal, Joseph Carleton Beal, Jim Boothe, James Ross Boothe Bobby Helms 2:12 10. \"Father and Son\" Calvin Massey, David Newman , Cat Stevens David Newman 3:00 11. \"Finale\" Geoffrey Burgon , Alfred Newman , Stephen Schwartz David Newman 4:02 12. \"Deep in the Heart of Xmas\" Sammy Hagar , Jesse Harms The Brian Setzer Orchestra and Darlene Love 2:52 Release [ edit ] As Schwarzenegger only signed on for the film in February and the film was shot so quickly, only six and a half months were available for merchandising, instead of the ideal year. As such, merchandising was limited to a 13.5 inch replica $25 Talking Turbo-Man action figure and the West Coast exclusive Turbo-Man Time Racer vehicle, while no tie-in promotions could be secured. [2] [4] Despite this, several critics wrote that the film was only being made in order to sell the toy. Columbus dismissed this notion, stating that with only roughly 200,000 Turbo-Man toys being made, the merchandising was far less than the year's other releases, such as Space Jam and 101 Dalmatians . [5] The film's release coincided with the Tickle Me Elmo craze, in which high demand for the doll during the 1996 Christmas season lead to store mobbing similar to that depicted for Turbo-Man. The world premiere was held on November 16, 1996 at the Mall of America in Bloomington where parts of the film were shot. A day of events was held to celebrate the film's release and Schwarzenegger donated memorabilia from the film to the Mall's Planet Hollywood . [1] Opening on November 22 [23] in 2,401, Jingle All the Way made $12.1 million in its first weekend, opening at #4 behind Star Trek: First Contact , Space Jam and Ransom ; it went on to gross $129 million worldwide, recouping its $75 million budget. [24] [25] The film was released on VHS in October 1997, [26] and in November 1998 it was released on DVD . [27] It was rereleased on DVD in December 2004, [28] followed by an extended director's cut in October 2007, known as the \"Family Fun Edition\". It contained several minutes of extra footage, as well as other DVD extras such as a behind the scenes featurette. [29] [30] In December of the following year, the Family Fun Edition was released on Blu-ray Disc . [31] The film was released in the United Kingdom on December 6, 1996, and topped the country's box office that weekend. Reception [ edit ] \"Despite its fairly entertaining buildup and somewhat serious commentary on materialism during the holidays, the end of the movie takes a realistic conceit and adds in comedy sci-fi elements. Not only does the movie take a turn for the cartoony, but the end is basically everybody laughing and learning their lesson, without any realistic resolution of the situation. It's as if the screenwriters couldn't figure an easy way out of Howard's situation, so they added in slapstick comedy and the ending from an episode of Full House .\" \u2014 Mike Drucker. [28] The film received a 16% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes , where it has 35 negative reviews out of 42 counted. [32] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale. [33] Emanuel Levy felt the film \"highly formulaic\" and criticized Levant's direction as little more advanced than a television sitcom. Although he felt Hartman, Wilson and Conrad were not given much opportunity to shine due to the script, he opined that \"Schwarzenegger has developed a light comic delivery, punctuated occasionally by an ironic one-liner,\" while \"Sinbad has good moments\". [34] Neil Jeffries of Empire disagreed, feeling Schwarzenegger to be \"wooden\" and Sinbad to be \"trying desperately to be funnier than his hat\" but praised Lloyd as the \"saving grace\" of the film. [35] The New York Times critic Janet Maslin felt the film lacked any real plot, failed in its attempt at satire, should have included Myron's only mentioned son and \"mostly wasted\" Hartman, while Levant's direction was \"listless\". [36] Similarly, the BBC 's Neil Smith criticized the film's script, its focus on the commercialization of Christmas, as well as Schwarzenegger's performance which shows \"the comic timing of a dead moose,\" but singled out Hartman for praise. [8] Chicago Tribune critic Michael Wilmington panned the film, wondering why the characters (primarily Howard) acted so illogically: \"Howard Langston is supposed to be a successful mattress manufacturer, but the movie paints him as a hot-tempered buffoon without a sensible idea in his head.\" [37] Jack Garner of USA Today condemned the film, finding it more \"cynical\" than satirical, stating \"this painfully bad movie has been inspired strictly by the potential jingle of cash registers.\" He wrote of Levant's directorial failure as he \"offers no...sense of comic timing,\" while \"pauses in the midst of much of the dialogue are downright painful.\" [38] Trevor Johnston suggested that the film \"seems to mark a point of decline in the Schwarzenegger career arc\" and the anti-consumerism message largely failed, with \"Jim Belushi's corrupt mall Santa with his stolen-goods warehouse...provid[ing] the film's sole flash of dark humour.\" [39] IGN 's Mike Drucker praised its subject matter as \"one of the few holiday movies to directly deal with the commercialization of Christmas\" although felt the last twenty minutes of the film let it down, as the first hour or so had \"some family entertainment\" value if taken with a \"grain of salt\". He concluded the film was \"a member of the so-corny-its-good genre,\" while \"Arnold delivers plenty of one-liners ripe for sound board crank callers.\" [28] Jamie Malanowski of The New York Times praised the film's satirical premise but felt it was \"full of unrealized potential\" because \"the filmmakers [wrongly] equate mayhem with humor.\" [40] Roger Ebert gave the film two-and-a-half stars, writing that he \"liked a lot of the movie\", which he thought had \"energy\" and humor which would have mass audience appeal. He was, though, disappointed by \"its relentlessly materialistic view of Christmas, and by the choice to go with action and (mild) violence over dialogue and plot.\" [41] Kevin Carr of 7M Pictures concluded that while the film is not very good, as a form of family entertainment it is \"surprisingly fun.\" [30] Brian Levant was nominated for the Razzie Award for Worst Director , but lost to Andrew Bergman for Striptease ; Sinbad, however, won the Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Favorite Supporting Actor in a Family film. [42] Lawsuit [ edit ] In 1998, Murray Hill Publishing sued 20th Century Fox for $150,000, claiming that the idea for the film was stolen from a screenplay they had purchased from high school teacher Brian Webster entitled Could This Be Christmas? . They said the script had 36 similarities with Jingle All the Way , including the plot, dialogue and character names. [43] [44] [45] [46] Murray Hill President Bob Laurel bought the script from Webster in 1993, and sent it to Fox and other studios in 1994 but received no response and claimed the idea was copied by Kornfield, who was Fox's script reader. [43] In 2001, Fox were found guilty of stealing the idea and ordered to pay $19 million ($15 million in damages and $4 million in legal costs) to Murray Hill, with Webster to receive a portion. [43] [46] [47] Laurel died a few months after the verdict, before receiving any of the money. [48] On appeal, the damages figure was lowered to $1.5 million, before the verdict itself was quashed in 2004 after a judge decided the idea was not stolen, as Fox had bought Kornfield's screenplay before he or anybody else at Fox had read Could This Be Christmas? . [49] [50] Sequel [ edit ] A stand-alone sequel, Jingle All the Way 2 , was released straight-to-DVD in December 2014. Directed by Alex Zamm and produced by WWE Studios and 20th Century Fox , the film has a similar plot to the original, but is otherwise not connected and none of the original cast or characters returned. The lead roles were instead played by Larry the Cable Guy and Santino Marella .

New Zealand is a constitutional monarchy in which a hereditary monarch\u2014since 6 February 1952, Queen Elizabeth II \u2014is the sovereign and head of state . Executive power in New Zealand is based on the principle that \"The Queen reigns, but the government rules\". [1] Although an integral part of the process of government, the Queen and her Governor-General remain politically neutral and are not involved in the everyday aspects of governing. Ministers are selected from among the democratically elected members of the New Zealand Parliament . Most ministers are members of Cabinet , which is the main decision-making body of the Government . The Prime Minister is the most senior minister, chair of the Cabinet, and thus head of government , holding office on commission from the Governor-General. The office of prime minister is, in practice, the most powerful political office in New Zealand. The Government is accountable to Parliament for its actions and policies. The country has a multi-party system in which many of its legislative practices derive from the unwritten conventions of and precedents set by the United Kingdom's Westminster Parliament . However, New Zealand has evolved variations; minority governments are common and typically dependent on confidence and supply agreements with other parties. The two dominant political parties in New Zealand have historically been the Labour Party and the National Party (or its predecessors). The Economist Intelligence Unit rated New Zealand as \" full democracy \" in 2016.

[1] The Constitution Act in 1852 established the system of government and these were later consolidated in 1986 . Constitutional rights are protected under common law and are strengthened by the Bill of Rights Act 1990 and Human Rights Act 1993 , although these are not entrenched and can be overturned by Parliament with a simple majority. [3] The Constitution Act 1986 describes the three branches of government in New Zealand: the Executive (the Sovereign and Cabinet), the legislature (Parliament) and the judiciary (Courts). [4] Legislature [ edit ] Main article: New Zealand Parliament See also: Elections in New Zealand and Electoral system of New Zealand Parliament House is the home of the House of Representatives Main office holders Office Name Party Since Queen Elizabeth II 6 February 1952 Governor-General Dame Patsy Reddy 28 September 2016 Speaker of the House Trevor Mallard Labour 7 November 2017 Leader of the House Chris Hipkins Labour 26 October 2017 Parliament is responsible for passing laws ( statutes ), adopting the state's budgets , and exercising control of the Government. [5] It currently has a single chamber , the House of Representatives . Before 1951 there was a second chamber, the Legislative Council . [6] Suffrage is extended to everyone over the age of 18 years, women having gained the vote in 1893. [7] Members of Parliament are elected for a maximum term of three years, although an election may be called earlier in exceptional circumstances. [8] The House of Representatives meets in Parliament House, Wellington . [9] Almost all parliamentary general elections between 1853 and 1996 were held under the first past the post (FPP) electoral system . [10] Under FPP the candidate in a given electorate that received the most votes was elected to parliament. The only deviation from the FPP system during this time occurred in the 1908 election when a second ballot system was tried. [10] Under this system the elections since 1935 have been dominated by two political parties , National and Labour . [10] Criticism of the FPP system began in the 1950s and intensified after Labour lost the 1978 and 1981 elections despite having more overall votes than National. [11] An indicative (non-binding) referendum to change the voting system was held in 1992, which led to a binding referendum during the 1993 election . [11] As a result, New Zealand has used the mixed-member proportional (MMP) system since 1996. [12] Under MMP, each Member of Parliament is either elected by voters in a single-member constituency via FPP or appointed from party lists. Officially, the New Zealand parliament has 120 seats, however this sometimes differs due to overhangs and underhangs . Several seats are reserved for members elected on a separate M\u0101ori roll. However, M\u0101ori may choose to vote in and to run for the non-reserved seats and for the party list (since 1996), and as a result many have now entered Parliament outside of the reserved seats. [13] Executive [ edit ] Main article: Government of New Zealand The \" Beehive \" is the seat of the New Zealand Government Main office holders Office Name Party Since Queen Elizabeth II 6 February 1952 Governor-General Dame Patsy Reddy 28 September 2016 Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern Labour 26 October 2017 Jacinda Ardern, Prime Minister since October 2017 Queen Elizabeth II is New Zealand's sovereign and head of state . [14] [4] The New Zealand monarchy has been distinct from the British monarchy since the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947 , and all Elizabeth II's official business in New Zealand is conducted in the name of the \" Queen of New Zealand \". [15] [16] The Queen's role is largely ceremonial, and her residual powers\u2014the \" royal prerogative \"\u2014are mostly exercised through the government of the day. These include the power to enact legislation , to sign treaties and to declare war. [17] Since the Queen is not usually resident in New Zealand, the functions of the monarchy are conducted by a representative, the Governor-General . [18] As of 2017 [update] , the Governor-General is Dame Patsy Reddy . [19] The Governor-General formally has the power to appoint and dismiss ministers and to dissolve Parliament; and the power to reject or sign bills into law by Royal Assent after passage by Parliament. The Governor-General chairs the Executive Council , which is a formal committee consisting of all ministers. Members of the Executive Council are required to be members of Parliament (MPs), and most are also in the Cabinet. [20] Cabinet is the most senior policy -making body and is led by the Prime Minister , who is also, by convention, the parliamentary leader of the governing party or coalition. The Prime Minister, being the de facto leader of New Zealand, exercises executive functions that are formally vested in the monarch (by way of the royal prerogative powers). [21] Cabinet is directly responsible to the New Zealand Parliament, from which its members are derived; ministers are collectively responsible for all decisions made. [22] The most recent general election, held in September 2017 , saw Labour finish in second place but able to govern through a coalition with New Zealand First , and a confidence and supply agreement with the Green Party . [23] The Sixth Labour Government , led by Jacinda Ardern , was sworn in on 26 October 2017. [24] The National Party forms the Official Opposition to the government. [23] The Leader of the Opposition is viewed as the leader of the \"government-in-waiting\". [25] Judiciary [ edit ] Main article: Judiciary of New Zealand The Supreme Court building, Wellington New Zealand has four levels of courts: The Supreme Court of New Zealand , The Court of Appeal , The High Court , and The District Court (including the Youth Court). [26] The Supreme Court was established in 2004, under the Supreme Court Act 2003 , [27] and replaced the Privy Council in London as New Zealand's court of last resort . [28] The High Court deals with serious criminal offences and civil matters, and hears appeals from subordinate courts. The Court of Appeal hears appeals from the High Court on points of law. [26] The Chief Justice of New Zealand (the head of the New Zealand Judiciary) presides over the Supreme Court, and is appointed by the Governor-General on the advice of the Prime Minister. The incumbent is Dame Sian Elias . [29] All other superior court judges are appointed on the advice of the Chief Justice, the Attorney-General , and the Solicitor-General . [30] Judges and judicial officers are appointed non-politically and under strict rules regarding tenure to help maintain independence from the executive government. [31] Judges are appointed according to their qualifications, personal qualities, and relevant experience. [32] A judge may not be removed from office except by the Attorney-General upon an address of the House of Representatives (Parliament) for proved misbehaviour. [31] New Zealand law has three principal sources: English common law , certain statutes of the United Kingdom Parliament enacted before 1947 (notably the Bill of Rights 1689 ), and statutes of the New Zealand Parliament. [33] In interpreting common law, the courts have endeavoured to preserve uniformity with common law as interpreted in the United Kingdom and related jurisdictions. [34] Local government [ edit ] Main article: Local government in New Zealand New Zealand is a unitary state rather than a federation \u2014 regions are created by the authority of the central government, rather than the central government being created by the authority of the regions. Local government in New Zealand has only the powers conferred upon it by Parliament. [35] These powers have traditionally been distinctly fewer than in some other countries; for example, police and education are run by central government . [36] Local elections are held every three years to elect the mayors, city and district councillors, community board members, and district health board members. [37] Elections and party politics [ edit ] Main articles: Elections in New Zealand and List of political parties in New Zealand The first political party in New Zealand was founded in 1891, and its main rival was founded in 1909\u2014New Zealand had a de facto two-party system from that point until a change of electoral system in 1996. Since then New Zealand has been a multi-party system, with at least five parties elected in every election since. No party has been able to govern without support from other groups since 1996, making coalition government standard. [38] Historically the two largest, and oldest, parties are the Labour Party (centre-left, formed in 1916) and the National Party (centre-right, formed in 1936). Other parties represented in Parliament as of 2017 [update] are ACT (right-wing, free-market ), the Greens (left-wing, environmentalist ) and New Zealand First ( populist ). e \u2022 d Summary of the 23 September 2017 election result for the New Zealand House of Representatives [39] Party Votes % of votes Seats % Change Electorate List Total Change [a] National 1,152,075 44.45 \u22122.59 41 15 56 \u22124 Labour 956,184 36.89 +11.76 29 17 46 +14 NZ First 186,706 7.20 \u22121.46 0 9 9 \u22122 Green 162,443 6.27 \u22124.43 0 8 8 \u22126 ACT 13,075 0.50 \u22120.19 1 0 1 0 Opportunities 63,260 2.44 +2.44 [b] 0 0 0 0 M\u0101ori 30,580 1.18 \u22120.14 0 0 0 \u22122 Legalise Cannabis 8,075 0.31 \u22120.14 0 0 0 0 Conservative 6,253 0.24 \u22123.75 0 0 0 0 Mana 3,642 0.14 \u22121.28 [c] 0 0 0 0 Ban 1080 3,005 0.12 \u22120.10 0 0 0 0 People's Party 1,890 0.07 +0.07 [b] 0 0 0 0 United Future 1,782 0.07 \u22120.15 0 0 0 \u22121 Outdoors 1,620 0.06 +0.06 [b] 0 0 0 0 Democrats 806 0.03 \u22120.04 0 0 0 0 Internet 499 0.02 \u22121.40 [c] 0 0 0 0 total 2,591,896 100.00 71 49 120 \u22121 [d] Labour minority government [e] 1,305,333 50.36 +5.88 29 34 63 +6 Opposition parties 1,165,150 44.95 \u20132.27 42 15 57 \u22124 Party informal votes 10,793 Disallowed votes 27,484 Total votes cast 2,630,173 Turnout 79.8% Total electorate 3,298,009 History [ edit ] See also: History of voting in New Zealand Prior to New Zealand becoming a British colony in 1840, politics in New Zealand was dominated by M\u0101ori chiefs as leaders of hapu and iwi , utilising M\u0101ori customs as a political system. [40] Colonial politics [ edit ] Manuscript copy of the Treaty of Waitangi (in M\u0101ori ) After the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi , a colonial Governor and his small staff acted on behalf of the British government based on the British political system. [41] Whereas M\u0101ori systems had dominated prior to 1840 governors attempting to introduce British systems met with mixed success in M\u0101ori communities. More isolated M\u0101ori were little influenced by the Government. Most influences were felt in and around Russell , the first capital , and Auckland , the second capital. The first voting rights in New Zealand were legislated in 1852 as the New Zealand Constitution Act for the 1853 elections and reflected British practice. [41] Initially only property owners could vote, but by the late 1850s 75% of British males over 21 were eligible to vote compared to 20% in England and 12% in Scotland. Around 100 M\u0101ori chiefs voted in the 1853 election. [42] During the 1850s provincial -based government was the norm. It was abolished in 1876. [41] Politics was initially dominated by conservative and wealthy \"wool lords\" who owned multiple sheep farms, mainly in Canterbury . During the gold rush era starting 1858 suffrage was extended to all British gold miners who owned a 1-pound mining license. The conservatives had been influenced by the militant action of gold miners in Victoria at Eureka. Many gold miners had moved to the New Zealand fields bringing their radical ideas. The extended franchise was modelled on the Victorian system. In 1863 the mining franchise was extended to goldfield business owners. By 1873 of the 41,500 registered voters 47% were gold field miners or owners. [ citation needed ] After the brief Land War period ending in 1864, Parliament moved to extend the franchise to more M\u0101ori. Donald McLean introduced a bill for four temporary M\u0101ori electorates and extended the franchise to all M\u0101ori men over 21 in 1867. As such, M\u0101ori were universally franchised 12 years prior to European men. [43] In 1879 an economic depression hit, resulting in poverty and many people, especially miners, returning to Australia. Between 1879 and 1881 Government was concerned at the activities of M\u0101ori activists based on confiscated land at Parihaka . Activists destroyed settlers farm fences and ploughed up roads and land [44] which incensed local farmers. Arrests followed but the activities persisted. Fears grew among settlers that the resistance campaign was a prelude to armed conflict. [45] The government itself was puzzled as to why the land had been confiscated and offered a huge 25,000 acre reserve to the activists, provided they stopped the destruction. [46] Commissioners set up to investigate the issue said that the activities \"could fairly be called hostile\". [46] A power struggle ensued resulting in the arrest of all the prominent leaders by a large government force in 1881. Historian Hazel Riseborough describes the event as a conflict over who had authority or mana -the Government or the Parihaka protestors. [47] Richard Seddon 's statue stands outside Parliament buildings in Wellington. In 1882 the export of meat in the first refrigerated ship started a period of sustained economic export led growth. This period is notable for the influence of new social ideas and movements such as the Fabians and the creation in 1890 of the first political party, the Liberals . Their leader, former gold miner Richard Seddon from Lancashire, was Premier from 1893 to 1906. The Liberals introduced new taxes to break the influence of the wealthy conservative sheep farm owners. They also purchased more land from M\u0101ori. [48] In 1896 Maori made up 2.9% of the population but owned 15% of the land. [ citation needed ] Far more small farms and a new land owning class were created during this period. Women in politics [ edit ] Further information: Women's suffrage in New Zealand Women's suffrage was granted after about two decades of campaigning by women such as Kate Sheppard and Mary Ann M\u00fcller and organisations such as the New Zealand branch of the Women's Christian Temperance Union . On 19 September 1893 the governor, Lord Glasgow , signed a new Electoral Act into law. [49] As a result, New Zealand became the first self-governing nation in the world in which all women had the right to vote in parliamentary elections. [7] Women first voted in the 1893 election , with a high 85% turnout (compared to 70% of men). [50] Women were not eligible to be elected to the House of Representatives until 1919 though, when three women, including Ellen Melville stood. The first woman to win an election (to the seat held by her late husband) was Elizabeth McCombs in 1933. [49] Mabel Howard became the first female cabinet minister in 1947, being appointed to the First Labour Government. [51] New Zealand was the first country in the world in which all the highest offices were occupied by women, between March 2005 and August 2006: the Sovereign Queen Elizabeth II of New Zealand , Governor-General Dame Silvia Cartwright , Prime Minister Helen Clark , Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives Margaret Wilson and Chief Justice Dame Sian Elias .

(January 2017) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) The right-leaning National Party and the left-leaning Labour Party have dominated New Zealand political life since a Labour government came to power in 1935. During fourteen years in office (1935\u20131949), the Labour Party implemented a broad array of social and economic legislation, including comprehensive social security , a large scale public works programme, a forty-hour working week, a minimum basic wage, and compulsory unionism . The National Party won control of the government in 1949 and adopted many welfare measures instituted by the Labour Party. Except for two brief periods of Labour governments in 1957-1960 and 1972\u20131975, National held power until 1984. After regaining control in 1984, the Labour government instituted a series of radical market-oriented reforms in response to New Zealand's mounting external debt. It also enacted anti-nuclear legislation that effectively brought about New Zealand's suspension from the ANZUS security alliance with the United States and Australia , and instituted a number of other more left-wing reforms, such as allowing the Waitangi Tribunal to hear claims of breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi to be made back to 1840, reinstituting compulsory unionism and creating new government agencies to implement a social and environmental reform agenda (women's affairs, youth affairs, Pacific Island affairs, consumer affairs, Minister for the Environment). In October 1990, the National Party again formed a government, for the first of three three-year terms. In 1996, New Zealand inaugurated the new electoral system ( mixed-member proportional representation ) to elect its Parliament . The system was expected (among numerous other goals) to increase representation of smaller parties in Parliament and appears to have done so in the MMP elections to date. Since 1996, neither National nor Labour has had an absolute majority in Parliament, and for all but two of those years a minority government has ruled. In 1995 Georgina Beyer became the world's first openly transsexual mayor, and in 1999 she became the world's first openly transsexual Member of Parliament . After nine years in office, the National Party lost the November 1999 election . Labour under Helen Clark out-polled National by 39% to 30% and formed a coalition, minority government with the left-wing Alliance . The government often relied on support from the Green Party to pass legislation. The Labour Party retained power in the 27 July 2002 election , forming a coalition with Jim Anderton 's new party, the Progressive Coalition , and reaching an agreement for support with the United Future party. Helen Clark remained Prime Minister. Following the 2005 general election on 17 September 2005, negotiations between parties culminated in Helen Clark announcing a third consecutive term of Labour-led government. The Labour Party again formed a coalition with Jim Anderton's Progressive Party , with confidence and supply from Winston Peters ' New Zealand First and Peter Dunne 's United Future. Jim Anderton retained his Cabinet position; Winston Peters became Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Racing and Associate Minister for Senior Citizens; Peter Dunne became Minister of Revenue and Associate Minister of Health. Neither Peters nor Dunne were in Cabinet. After the general election in November 2008 , the National Party moved quickly to form a minority government with the ACT Party, the Maori Party and United Future. This arrangement allowed National to decrease its reliance on the right-leaning ACT party, whose policies are sometimes controversial with the greater New Zealand public. In 2008, John Key became Prime Minister , with Bill English his deputy. This arrangement conformed to a tradition of having a north-south split in the major parties' leadership, as Key's residence is in Auckland and English's electorate is in the South Island. On 12 December 2016, English was elected Prime Minister by the National Party caucus after Key's unexpected resignation a week earlier. Paula Bennett (member for Upper Harbour ) was elected Deputy Prime Minister , thus continuing the tradition. [53] Following the 2017 general election National retained its plurality in the House of Representatives, while Labour greatly increased its proportion of the vote and number of seats. In a first under the MMP system, Labour formed a minority government after securing a coalition arrangement with New Zealand First. Jacinda Ardern , Labour leader, became Prime Minister, with Winston Peters becoming Deputy Prime Minister. The Labour government also has a confidence and supply agreement with the Green Party.

{"question": "season 10 of comedians in cars getting coffee", "answer": "", "context": "Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee - Wikipedia Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee Genre Talk show Comedy Created by Jerry Seinfeld Directed by Jerry Seinfeld Starring Jerry Seinfeld Country of origin United States Original language(s) English No. of seasons 9 No. of episodes 60 ( list of episodes ) Production Executive producer(s) Jerry Seinfeld Running time 6\u201323 minutes Distributor Sony Pictures Television Release Original network Crackle (2012\u201317) Netflix (2018) [1] Picture format 16:9 HDTV Original release July 19, 2012 ( 2012-07-19 ) \u2013 present Chronology Related shows Seinfeld External links Website Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee is an American web series talk show directed and hosted by comedian Jerry Seinfeld , distributed for the first nine seasons by digital network Crackle , then moving to Netflix for season ten (2018). The series premiered on July 19, 2012. Episodes feature Seinfeld introducing a vintage car selected for a guest comedian, followed by a drive to a pre-selected caf\u00e9 or restaurant for coffee. Episodes diverge from the format spontaneously, as when Michael Richards implores Seinfeld to take a side street, when Seinfeld returns after coffee with Carl Reiner to join him for dinner with Mel Brooks \u2014or when car trouble arises. As of May 2015, the series had been streamed nearly 100 million times. [2] The show's ninth season premiered on January 5, 2017. That same month it was announced that the series would migrate from Crackle to Netflix , with the ninth season being the final one to premiere on Crackle. [3] Twenty-four new episodes will stream on Netflix in 2018, with most of the previous episodes becoming available on the streaming service starting on January 5, 2018\u2014the episode with Louis C.K. was not included in the collection until January 10th, and the episode with Jason Alexander in character as George Costanza was not included. [1] The previous episodes were repackaged into four \"collections\" for Netflix, reordering the episodes and removing the product placement spots.

[4] Later describing the birth of the series Seinfeld said the series birth was \"an experiment\" [5] \u2014as \"kind of a guess.\" [6] Prior to development of the series, Seinfeld was told by leading social network advisers, including those at Facebook and Yahoo , that a show length exceeding five minutes had little chance of success on the web. [7] Howard Schultz , coffee magnate and Chairman of Starbucks , turned down the opportunity to sponsor the show. [7] Acura eventually sponsored the show, giving Seinfeld creative license with creating the commercials and product placements. [7] Format [ edit ] Episodes are estimated to cost roughly $100,000, [5] with guests being paid in cash and the initial raw shoot lasting on average three-and-a-half hours, [5] which is then edited over a two-week period down to a 12\u201320 minute episode. [5] The process uses a lean production staff, [5] involves a minimum of network interaction, [5] and is designed as an edited and unscripted talk show without an audience that can be comfortably watched on a smart phone . [5] The show's format around the car drive and \"movement,\" specifically because \"when attempting to show the meandering, silly and sometimes deep conversations that comedians share, you have to remove the audience to keep the participants from dropping into their acts,\" [5] adding that \"part of what makes the show watchable is that it's always moving. There's no narrative [to] drive the story. We know what happens. We know they're going to get coffee. You need a kinetic energy to move it along, moving people around keeps them awake.\" [5] Bob Einstein became the first repeat guest on the show, appearing in the first season and again in the ninth season. Jimmy Fallon 's appearance in the fifth season was split into two episodes. Several episodes have featured multiple guests appearing together including: Carl Reiner and Mel Brooks , Colin Quinn and Mario Joyner , and Kathleen Madigan and Chuck Martin. Colleen Ballinger appeared in-character as Miranda Sings as a guest on an episode, and Jason Alexander reprised the role of George Costanza from Seinfeld for an episode.

And the filming and editing are, if you break them down, impressively complex and artful for a Web series.\" [26] The New York Times ' s Anand Giridharadas critiqued the show as being out of touch with the everyman , and more of a showcase of Seinfeld's wealth. Giridharadas wrote: \"The democracy of observational humor has become, in Mr. Seinfeld's reincarnation, an oligarchy of mutual admiration\". [27] Other publications have been more positive in their opinion. The New York Daily News wrote of the show's format and first three seasons that, \"It all sounds random, which it is, and trivial, which it is and isn\u2019t.

{"question": "where does the term dog and pony show come from", "answer": "toured through small towns and rural areas. The name derives from the common use", "context": "Dog and pony show - Wikipedia Dog and pony show From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search For other uses, see Dog and pony show (disambiguation) . Advertisement for Prof. Gentry's Dog and Pony Show, 1900 \" Dog and pony show \" is a colloquial term which has come to mean a highly promoted, often over-staged performance, presentation, or event designed to sway or convince opinion for political, or less often, commercial ends. Typically, the term is used in a pejorative sense to connote disdain, jocular lack of appreciation, or distrust of the message being presented or the efforts undertaken to present it. [1] Origins [ edit ] The term was originally used in the United States in the late-19th and early-20th centuries to refer to small traveling circuses that toured through small towns and rural areas. The name derives from the common use of performing dogs and ponies as the main attractions of the events. [2] Performances were generally held in open-air arenas, such as race tracks or public spaces in localities that were too small or remote to attract larger, more elaborate performers or performances. The most notorious was \u201cProf. Gentry's Famous Dog & Pony Show,\u201d started when teenager Henry Gentry and his brothers started touring in 1886 with their act, originally entitled \u201cGentry\u2019s Equine and Canine Paradox.\u201d It started small, but evolved into a full circus show. [3] Other early dog and pony shows included Morris\u2019 Equine and Canine Paradoxes (1883) and Hurlburt\u2019s Dog and Pony Show (late 1880s). [ citation needed ] By the latter part of the 20th century, the original meaning of the term had been largely lost.

Despite concerns about the reliability of early sources, most historians [1] believe that Islam originated in Mecca and Medina at the start of the 7th century. Muslims however believe that it did not start with Muhammad , but that it was the original faith of others whom they regard as Prophets , such as Jesus , David , Moses , Abraham , Noah and Adam . [2] [3] [4] In 610 CE , Muhammad began receiving what Muslims consider to be divine revelations. [5] Muhammad's message won over a handful of followers and was met with increasing opposition from notables of Mecca . [6] In 618, after he lost protection with the death of his influential uncle Abu Talib , Muhammad migrated to the city of Yathrib ( Medina ). With Muhammad's death in 632, disagreement broke out over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community which was eventually resurrected leading to the First Fitna . The dispute would intensify greatly after the Battle of Karbala , in which Muhammad's grandson Hussein ibn Ali was killed by the ruling Umayyad Caliph Yazid\u00a0I , and the outcry for revenge divided the early Islamic community. By the 8th century , the Islamic empire extended from Iberia in the west to the Indus river in the east. Polities such as those ruled by the Umayyads (in the Middle East and later in Iberia ), Abbasids , Fatimids , and Mamluks were among the most influential powers in the world. The Islamic civilization gave rise to many centers of culture and science and produced notable astronomers , mathematicians , doctors and philosophers during the Golden Age of Islam . In the early 13th century , the Delhi Sultanate took over northern parts of Indian subcontinent . In the 13th and 14th centuries, destructive Mongol invasions from the East, along with the loss of population in the Black Death , greatly weakened the traditional centers of the Islamic world, stretching from Persia to Egypt , but in the Early Modern period , the Ottomans , the Safavids , and the Mughals were able to create new world powers again. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, most parts of the Muslim world fell under the influence or direct control of European \" Great Powers .\" Their efforts to win independence and build modern nation states over the course of the last two centuries continue to reverberate to the present day.

It covers major historical centers of power and culture, including Arabia , Mesopotamia (modern Iraq ), Persia (modern Iran ), Levant (modern Syria , Lebanon , Jordan and Israel/Palestine ), Egypt , Maghreb (north-west Africa), al-Andalus ( Iberia ), Transoxania ( Central Asia ), Hindustan (including modern Pakistan ), and Anatolia (modern Turkey ). It is necessarily an approximation, since rule over some regions was sometimes divided among different centers of power, and authority in larger polities was often distributed among several dynasties. For example, during the later stages of the Abbasid Caliphate , even the capital city of Baghdad was effectively ruled by other dynasties such as the Buyyids and the Seljuks , while the Ottomans commonly delegated executive authority over outlying provinces to local potentates, such as the Deys of Algiers, the Beys of Tunis , and the Mamluks of Iraq . Dates are approximate, consult particular articles for details. Early sources [ edit ] Main article: Historiography of early Islam The study of the earliest periods in Islamic history is made difficult by a lack of sources. [7] For example, the most important historiographical source for the origins of Islam is the work of al-Tabari . [8] While al-Tabari was an excellent historian by the standards of his time and place, use of his work as a source is problematic for two reasons. For one, his style of historical writing permitted liberal use of mythical, legendary, stereotyped, distorted, and polemical presentations of its subject matter. Second, al-Tabari's descriptions of the beginning of Islam post-date the events by a large amount of time, al-Tabari having died in 923 CE. [9] [10] Differing views about how to deal with the available sources has led to the development of four different approaches to the history of early Islam. All four methods have some level of support today. [11] [12] The descriptive method uses the outlines of Islamic traditions, while being adjusted for the stories of miracles and faith-centred claims within those sources. [13] Edward Gibbon and Gustav Weil represent some of the first historians following the descriptive method. On the source critical method, a comparison of all the sources is sought in order to identify which informants to the sources are weak and thereby distinguish spurious material. [14] The work of William Montgomery Watt and that of Wilferd Madelung are two source critical examples. On the tradition critical method, the sources are believed to be based on oral traditions with unclear origins and transmission history, and so are treated very cautiously. [15] Ignaz Goldziher was the pioneer of the tradition critical method, and Uri Rubin gives a contemporary example. The skeptical method doubts nearly all of the material in the traditional sources, regarding any possible historical core as too difficult to decipher from distorted and fabricated material. [16] An early example of the skeptical method was the work of John Wansbrough . Nowadays, the popularity of the different methods employed varies on the scope of the works under consideration. For overview treatments of the history of early Islam, the descriptive approach is more popular. For scholars who look at the beginnings of Islam in depth, the source critical and tradition critical methods are more often followed. [11] After the 8th century CE, the quality of sources improves. [17] Those sources which treated earlier times with a large temporal and cultural gap now begin to give accounts which are more contemporaneous, the quality of genre of available historical accounts improves, and new documentary sources\u2014such as official documents, correspondence and poetry\u2014appear. [17] For the time prior to the beginning of Islam\u2014in the 6th century CE\u2014sources are superior as well, if still of mixed quality. In particular, the sources covering the Sasanian realm of influence in the 6th century CE are poor, while the sources for Byzantine areas at the time are of a respectable quality, and complemented by Syriac Christian sources for Syria and Iraq. [18] Islamic origins [ edit ] Main articles: Pre-Islamic Arabia , Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia , Muhammad , and Quran See also: Early social changes under Islam Arabia united under Muhammad Islam arose within the context of Late Antiquity . [17] The second half of the sixth century was a period of political disorder in Arabia and communication routes were no longer secure. [19] Religious divisions were an important cause of the crisis. [20] Judaism became the dominant religion of Himyarite Kingdom in Yemen while Christianity took root in the Persian Gulf . [20] While much of Arabia remained polytheistic, in line with broader trends of the age there was yearning for a more spiritual form of religion. [20] Many were reluctant to convert to a foreign faith, but those faiths provided intellectual and spiritual reference points, and the old pagan vocabulary of Arabic began to be replaced by Jewish and Christian loanwords from Aramaic throughout the peninsula. [20] On the eve of the Islamic era, Quraysh was the chief tribe of Mecca and a dominant force in western Arabia. [21] To counter the effects of anarchy, they upheld the institution of \"sacred months\" when all violence was forbidden and travel was safe. [22] The polytheistic Kaaba shrine in Mecca and the surrounding area was a popular pilgrimage destination, which had significant economic consequences for the city. [22] [23] According to tradition, the Islamic prophet Muhammad was born in Mecca around the year 570. [24] His family belonged to the Quraysh . When he was about forty years old, he began receiving what Muslims consider to be divine revelations delivered through the angel Gabriel , which would later form the Quran , enjoining him to proclaim a strict monotheistic faith , warn his compatriots of the impending Judgement Day , and castigate social injustices of his city. [5] Muhammad's message won over a handful of followers and was met with increasing opposition from notables of Mecca. [6] In 618, after he lost protection with the death of his influential uncle Abu Talib , Muhammad took flight to the city of Yathrib (subsequently called Medina ) where he was joined by his followers. [25] Later generations would count this event, known as the hijra , as the start of the Islamic era. [26] In Yathrib, where he was accepted as an arbitrator among the different communities of the city under the terms of the Constitution of Medina , Muhammad began to lay the foundations of the new Islamic society, with the help of new Quranic verses which provided guidance on matters of law and religious observance. [26] The surahs of this period emphasized his place among the long line of Biblical prophets, but also differentiated the message of the Quran from Christianity and Judaism. [26] Armed conflict with Meccans and Jewish tribes of the Yathrib area soon broke out. [27] After a series of military confrontations and political maneuvers, Muhammad was able to secure control of Mecca and allegiance of the Quraysh in 629. [26] In the time remaining until his death in 632, tribal chiefs across the peninsula entered into various agreements with him, some under terms of alliance, others acknowledging his prophethood and agreeing to follow Islamic practices, including paying the alms levy to his government, which consisted of a number of deputies, an army of believers, and a public treasury. [26] A few months before his death, Muhammad delivered a sermon regarding his succession . The final verse of the Qur'an (Chapter 5, Verse 3) was revealed after Muhammad finished his sermon. On the orders of Muhammad, many Muslims, including Abu Bakr , Umar , and Uthman pledged allegiance to Ali at this event. [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] Rashidun Caliphate [ edit ] Main article: Rashidun Caliphate The Rashidun caliphate After Muhammad died, a series of four Caliphs governed the Islamic state: Abu Bakr (632\u2013634), Umar ibn al-Khattab (Umar \u0406, 634\u2013644), Uthman ibn Affan , (644\u2013656), and Ali ibn Abi Talib (656\u2013661). These leaders are known as the \" Rashidun \" or \"rightly guided\" Caliphs in Sunni Islam . They oversaw the initial phase of the Muslim conquests , advancing through Persia , Levant , Egypt , and North Africa . After Muhammad's death, Abu Bakr , one of his closest associates, was chosen as the first caliph ( Arabic : \u062e\u064e\u0644\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u200e khal\u012bfah , lit. successor). Although the office of caliph retained an aura of religious authority, it laid no claim to prophecy. [33] A number of tribal leaders refused to extend agreements made with Muhammad to Abu Bakr, ceasing payments of the alms levy and in some cases claiming to be prophets in their own right. [33] Abu Bakr asserted his authority in a successful military campaign known as the Ridda wars , whose momentum was carried into the lands of the Byzantine and Sasanian empires. [34] By the end of the reign of the second caliph, Umar I, Arab armies, whose battle-hardened ranks were now swelled by the defeated rebels [35] and former imperial auxiliary troops, [36] conquered the Byzantine provinces of Syria and Egypt, while the Sassanids lost their western territories , with the rest to follow soon afterwards . [33] Umar improved administration of the fledgling empire, ordering improvement of irrigation networks and playing a role in foundation of cities like Basra . To be close to the poor, he lived in a simple mud hut without doors and walked the streets every evening. After consulting with the poor, Umar established the Bayt al-mal , [37] [38] [39] a welfare institution for the Muslim and non-Muslim poor, needy, elderly, orphans, widows, and the disabled. The Bayt al-mal ran for hundreds of years under the Rashidun Caliphate in the 7th century and continued through the Umayyad period and well into the Abbasid era. Umar also introduced child benefit for the children and pensions for the elderly. [40] [41] [42] [43] When he felt that a governor or a commander was becoming attracted to wealth or did not meet the required administrative standards, he had him removed from his position. [44] The expansion was partially halted between 638\u2013639 during the years of great famine and plague in Arabia and Levant , respectively, but by the end of Umar's reign, Syria, Egypt , Mesopotamia, and much of Persia were incorporated into the Islamic State. The western parts of the Byzantine empire conquered by Arabs Local populations of Jews and indigenous Christians, who lived as religious minorities and were taxed (while Muslims paid \"Zakat\") to finance the Byzantine\u2013Sassanid Wars, often aided Muslims to take over their lands from the Byzantines and Persians, resulting in exceptionally speedy conquests. [45] [46] As new areas were conquered, they also benefited from free trade with other areas of the growing Islamic state, where, to encourage commerce, taxes were applied to wealth rather than trade. [47] The Muslims paid Zakat on their wealth for the benefit of the poor. Since the Constitution of Medina , drafted by the Islamic prophet Muhammad , the Jews and the Christians continued to use their own laws and had their own judges. [48] [49] [50] To assist in the quick expansion of the state, the Byzantine and the Persian tax collection systems were maintained and the people paid a poll tax lower than the one imposed under the Byzantines and the Persians. [ citation needed ] In 639, Muawiyah I was appointed as the governor of Syria after the previous governor died in a plague along with 25,000 other people. [51] [52] To stop the Byzantine harassment from the sea during the Arab\u2013Byzantine wars , in 649 Muawiyah I set up a navy, manned by Monophysitise Christians , Copts and Jacobite Syrian Christians sailors and Muslim troops, which defeated the Byzantine navy at the Battle of the Masts in 655, opening up the Mediterranean to Muslim ships. [53] [54] [55] [56] Early Muslim armies stayed in encampments away from cities because Umar feared that they may get attracted to wealth and luxury, moving away from the worship of God, accumulating wealth and establishing dynasties. [44] [57] [58] [59] Staying in these encampments away from the cities also ensured that there was no stress on the local populations which could remain autonomous. Some of these encampments later grew into cities like Basra and Kufa in Iraq and Fustat in Egypt. [60] When Umar was assassinated in 644, Uthman ibn Affan became the next caliph. As the Arabic language is written without vowels, speakers of different Arabic dialects and other languages recited the Quran with phonetic variations that could alter the meaning of the text. When Uthman ibn Affan became aware of this, he ordered a standard copy of the Quran to be prepared. Begun during his reign, the compilation of the Quran was finished some time between 650 and 656, and copies were sent out to the different centers of the expanding Islamic empire. [61] The Quran and Muhammad discussed racial equality and justice (notably in Muhammad's Farewell Sermon ), [62] [63] [ unreliable source? ] [64] [65] [ page\u00a0needed ] [66] [ non-primary source needed ] [67] [ non-primary source needed ] [68] [ non-primary source needed ] discouraging tribal and nationalistic differences. However, after Muhammad's death, the old tribal differences between the Arabs started to resurface. Following the Roman\u2013Persian Wars and the Byzantine\u2013Sassanid Wars deep-rooted differences between Iraq (formerly under the Persian Sassanid Empire ) and Syria (formerly under the Byzantine Empire ) also existed. Each wanted the capital of the newly established Islamic State to be in their area. [69] As Uthman ibn Affan became very old, Marwan I a relative of Muawiyah I slipped into the vacuum, becoming his secretary and slowly assuming more control. When Uthman was assassinated in 656, Ali ibn Abi Talib , a cousin and son-in-law of Muhammad, assumed the position of caliph and moved the capital to Kufa in Iraq. Muawiyah I, the governor of Syria, and Marwan I demanded arrest of the culprits. Marwan I manipulated every one and created conflict, which resulted in the first civil war (the \"First Fitna\"). Ali was assassinated by Kharijites in 661. Six months later in 661, in the interest of peace, Ali's son Hasan , made a peace treaty with Muawiyah I. In the Hasan\u2013Muawiya treaty , Hasan ibn Ali handed over power to Muawiya on the condition that he would be just to the people and not establish a dynasty after his death. [70] [71] Muawiyah subsequently broke the conditions of the agreement and established the Umayyad dynasty , with a capital in Damascus . [72] Husayn ibn Ali , by then Muhammad's only living grandson, refused to swear allegiance to the Umayyads. He was killed in the Battle of Karbala the same year, in an event still mourned by Shia on the Day of Ashura . Unrest, called the Second Fitna continued, but Muslim rule was extended under Muawiyah to Rhodes , Crete , Kabul , Bukhara , and Samarkand , and expanded in North Africa . In 664, Arab armies conquered Kabul , [73] and in 665 pushed into the Maghreb . [74] Umayyad Caliphate [ edit ] Main article: Umayyad Caliphate The Umayyad caliphate The Umayyad dynasty (or Ommiads ), whose name derives from Umayya ibn Abd Shams , the great-grandfather of the first Umayyad caliph, ruled from 661 to 750. Although the Umayyad family came from the city of Mecca , Damascus was the capital. After the death of Abdu'l-Rahman ibn Abu Bakr in 666, [75] [76] Muawiyah I consolidated his power. Muawiyah I moved his capital to Damascus from Medina , which led to profound changes in the empire. In the same way, at a later date, the transfer of the Caliphate from Damascus to Baghdad marked the accession of a new family to power. As the state grew, the state expenses increased. Additionally the Bayt al-mal and the Welfare State expenses to assist the Muslim and the non-Muslim poor, needy, elderly, orphans, widows, and the disabled, increased, the Umayyads asked the new converts (mawali) to continue paying the poll tax. The Umayyad rule, with its wealth and luxury also seemed at odds with the Islamic message preached by Muhammad. [77] [78] [79] All this increased discontent. [80] [81] The descendants of Muhammad's uncle Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib rallied discontented mawali , poor Arabs, and some Shi'a against the Umayyads and overthrew them with the help of the general Abu Muslim , inaugurating the Abbasid dynasty in 750, which moved the capital to Baghdad . [82] A branch of the Ummayad family fled across North Africa to Al-Andalus, where they established the Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba , which lasted until 1031 before falling due to the Fitna of al-Andalus . The Bayt al-mal, the Welfare State then continued under the Abbasids. At its largest extent, the Umayyad dynasty covered more than 5,000,000 square miles (13,000,000\u00a0km 2 ) making it one of the largest empires the world had yet seen, [83] and the fifth largest contiguous empire ever. Muawiyah beautified Damascus, and developed a court to rival that of Constantinople . He expanded the frontiers of the empire, reaching the edge of Constantinople at one point, though the Byzantines drove him back and he was unable to hold any territory in Anatolia . Sunni Muslims credit him with saving the fledgling Muslim nation from post- civil war anarchy. However, Shia Muslims accuse him of instigating the war, weakening the Muslim nation by dividing the Ummah , fabricating self-aggrandizing heresies [84] slandering the Prophet 's family [85] and even selling his Muslim critics into slavery in the Byzantine empire. [86] One of Muawiyah's most controversial and enduring legacies was his decision to designate his son Yazid as his successor. According to Shi'a doctrine, this was a clear violation of the treaty he made with Hasan ibn Ali. The Mosque of Uqba (Great Mosque of Kairouan), founded by the Umayyad general Uqba Ibn Nafi in 670 CE, is the oldest and most prestigious mosque in the Muslim West; its present form dates from the 9th century, Kairouan , Tunisia . In 682 CE Yazid restored Uqba ibn Nafi as the governor of North Africa. Uqba won battles against the Berbers and Byzantines. [87] From there Uqba marched thousands of miles westward towards Tangier , where he reached the Atlantic coast, and then marched eastwards through the Atlas Mountains . [88] With about 300 cavalrymen , he proceeded towards Biskra where he was ambushed by a Berber force under Kaisala. Uqba and all his men died fighting. The Berbers attacked and drove Muslims from north Africa for a period. [89] Weakened by the civil wars, the Umayyad lost supremacy at sea, and had to abandon the islands of Rhodes and Crete . Under the rule of Yazid I , some Muslims in Kufa began to think that if Husayn ibn Ali the descendent of Muhammad was their ruler, he would have been more just. He was invited to Kufa but was later betrayed and killed. Imam Husain's son, Imam Ali ibn Husain , was imprisoned along with Husain's sister and other ladies left in Karbala war. Due to opposition by public they were later released and allowed to go to their native place Medina. One Imam after another continued in the generation of Imam Husain but they were opposed by the Caliphs of the day as their rivals till Imam Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah came in power as first Caliph of Fatimid in North Africa when Caliphate and Imamate came to same person again after Imam Ali. These Imams were recognized by Shia Islam taking Imam Ali as first Caliph/ Imam and the same is institutionalised by the Safavids and many similar institutions named now as Ismaili , Twelver etc. The period under Muawiya II was marked by civil wars ( Second Fitna ). This would ease in the reign of Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan , a well-educated and capable ruler. Despite the many political problems that impeded his rule, all important records were translated into Arabic. In his reign, a currency for the Muslim world was minted. This led to war with the Byzantine Empire under Justinian II ( Battle of Sebastopolis ) in 692 in Asia Minor . The Byzantines were decisively defeated by the Caliph after the defection of a large contingent of Slavs . The Islamic currency was then made the exclusive currency in the Muslim world. [ citation needed ] He reformed agriculture and commerce. [ citation needed ] Abd al-Malik consolidated Muslim rule and extended it, made Arabic the state language, and organized a regular postal service . Umayyad army invades France after conquering the Iberian Peninsula Al-Walid I began the next stage of Islamic conquests. Under him the early Islamic empire reached its farthest extent. He reconquered parts of Egypt from the Byzantine Empire and moved on into Carthage and across to the west of North Africa. Muslim armies under Tariq ibn Ziyad crossed the Strait of Gibraltar and began to conquer the Iberian Peninsula using North African Berber armies. The Visigoths of the Iberian Peninsula were defeated when the Umayyad conquered Lisbon . The Iberian Peninsula was the farthest extent of Islamic control of Europe (they were stopped at the Battle of Tours ). In the east, Islamic armies under Muhammad bin Qasim made it as far as the Indus Valley . Under Al-Walid, the caliphate empire stretched from the Iberian Peninsula to India. Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf played a crucial role in the organization and selection of military commanders. Al-Walid paid great attention to the expansion of an organized military, building the strongest navy in the Umayyad era., This tactic was crucial for the expansion to the Iberian Peninsula. His reign is considered to be the apex of Islamic power. Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik was hailed as caliph the day al-Walid died. He appointed Yazid ibn al-Muhallab governor of Mesopotamia . Sulayman ordered the arrest and execution of the family of al-Hajjaj , one of two prominent leaders (the other was Qutayba ibn Muslim ) who had supported the succession of al-Walid's son Yazid, rather than Sulayman. Al-Hajjaj had predeceased al-Walid, so he posed no threat. Qutaibah renounced allegiance to Sulayman, though his troops rejected his appeal to revolt. They killed him and sent his head to Sulayman. Sulayman did not move to Damascus on becoming Caliph, remaining in Ramla . Sulayman sent Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik to attack the Byzantine capital ( siege of Constantinople ). The intervention of Bulgaria on the Byzantine side proved decisive. The Muslims sustained heavy losses. Sulayman died suddenly in 717. Yazid II came to power on the death of Umar II. Yazid fought the Kharijites, with whom Umar had been negotiating, and killed the Kharijite leader Shawdhab. In Yazid's reign, civil wars began in different parts of the empire. [90] Yazid expanded the Caliphate's territory into the Caucasus, before dying in 724. Inheriting the caliphate from his brother, Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik ruled an empire with many problems. He was effective in addressing these problems, and in allowing the Umayyad empire to continue as an entity. His long rule was an effective one, and renewed reforms introduced by Umar II. Under Hisham's rule, regular raids against the Byzantines continued. In North Africa, Kharijite teachings combined with local restlessness to produce the Berber Revolt . He was also faced with a revolt by Zayd ibn Ali . Hisham suppressed both revolts. The Abbasids continued to gain power in Khurasan and Iraq. However, they were not strong enough to make a move yet. Some were caught and punished or executed by eastern governors. The Battle of Akroinon , a decisive Byzantine victory, was during the final campaign of the Umayyad dynasty. [91] Hisham died in 743. Al-Walid II saw political intrigue during his reign. Yazid III spoke out against his cousin Walid's \"immorality\" which included discrimination on behalf of the Banu Qays Arabs against Yemenis and non-Arab Muslims , and Yazid received further support from the Qadariya and Murji'iya (believers in human free will ). [92] Walid was shortly thereafter deposed in a coup . [93] Yazid disbursed funds from the treasury and acceded to the Caliph. He explained that he had rebelled on behalf of the Book of Allah and the Sunna. Yazid reigned for only six months, while various groups refused allegiance and dissident movements arose, after which he died. Ibrahim ibn al-Walid , named heir apparent by his brother Yazid III, ruled for a short time in 744, before he abdicated. Marwan II ruled from 744 until he was killed in 750. He was the last Umayyad ruler to rule from Damascus. Marwan named his two sons Ubaydallah and Abdallah heirs. He appointed governors and asserted his authority by force. Anti-Umayyad feeling was very prevalent, especially in Iran and Iraq. The Abbasids had gained much support. Marwan's reign as caliph was almost entirely devoted to trying to keep the Umayyad empire together. His death signalled the end of Umayyad rule in the East, and was followed by the massacre of Umayyads by the Abbasids. Almost the entire Umayyad dynasty was killed, except for the talented prince Abd al-Rahman who escaped to the Iberian Peninsula and founded a dynasty there. Middle East during the Golden Age [ edit ] Main article: Islamic Golden Age Abbasid Caliphate [ edit ] Main article: Abbasid Caliphate Abbasid caliphate The Abbasid dynasty rose to power in 750, consolidating the gains of the earlier Caliphates . Initially, they conquered Mediterranean islands including the Balearics and, after, in 827 the Sicily . [94] The ruling party had come to power on the wave of dissatisfaction with the Umayyads, cultivated by the Abbasid revolutionary Abu Muslim . [95] [96] Under the Abbasids Islamic civilization flourished. Most notable was the development of Arabic prose and poetry , termed by The Cambridge History of Islam as its \" golden age \". [97] Commerce and industry (considered a Muslim Agricultural Revolution ) and the arts and sciences (considered a Muslim Scientific Revolution ) also prospered under Abbasid caliphs al-Mansur (ruled 754\u2013775), Harun al-Rashid (ruled 786\u2013809), al-Ma'mun (ruled 809\u2013813) and their immediate successors. [98] The capital was moved from Damascus to Baghdad , due to the importance placed by the Abbasids upon eastern affairs in Persia and Transoxania . [98] At this time the caliphate showed signs of fracture amid the rise of regional dynasties. Although the Umayyad family had been killed by the revolting Abbasids, one family member, Abd ar-Rahman I , escaped to Spain and established an independent caliphate there in 756. In the Maghreb , Harun al-Rashid appointed the Arab Aghlabids as virtually autonomous rulers, although they continued to recognise central authority. Aghlabid rule was short-lived, and they were deposed by the Shiite Fatimid dynasty in 909. By around 960, the Fatimids had conquered Abbasid Egypt, building a capital there in 973 called \" al-Qahirah \" (meaning \"the planet of victory\", known today as Cairo ). In Persia the Turkic Ghaznavids snatched power from the Abbasids. [99] [100] Abbasid influence had been consumed by the Great Seljuq Empire (a Muslim Turkish clan which had migrated into mainland Persia) by 1055. [98] Expansion continued, sometimes by force, sometimes by peaceful proselytising . [94] The first stage in the conquest of India began just before the year 1000. By some 200 (from 1193\u20131209) years later, the area up to the Ganges river had fallen. In sub-Saharan West Africa, Islam was established just after the year 1000. Muslim rulers were in Kanem starting from sometime between 1081 and 1097, with reports of a Muslim prince at the head of Gao as early as 1009. The Islamic kingdoms associated with Mali reached prominence in the 13th century. [101] The Abbasids developed initiatives aimed at greater Islamic unity. Different sects of the Islamic faith and mosques, separated by doctrine, history, and practice, were pushed to cooperate. The Abbasids also distinguished themselves from the Umayyads by attacking the Umayyads' moral character and administration. According to Ira Lapidus , \"The Abbasid revolt was supported largely by Arabs, mainly the aggrieved settlers of Marw with the addition of the Yemeni faction and their Mawali \". [102] The Abbasids also appealed to non-Arab Muslims, known as mawali , who remained outside the kinship -based society of the Arabs and were perceived as a lower class within the Umayyad empire. Islamic ecumenism , promoted by the Abbasids, refers to the idea of unity of the Ummah in the literal meaning: that there was a single faith. Islamic philosophy developed as the Shariah was codified, and the four Madhabs were established. This era also saw the rise of classical Sufism . Religious achievements included completion of the canonical collections of Hadith of Sahih Bukhari and others. [103] Islam recognized to a certain extent the validity of the Abrahamic religions , the Quran identifying Jews , Christians , Zoroastrians , and \" Sabi'un \" or \"baptists\" (usually taken as a reference to the Mandeans and related Mesopotamian groups) as \" people of the book \". Toward the beginning of the high Middle Ages, the doctrines of the Sunni and Shia , two major denominations of Islam , solidified and the divisions of the world theologically would form. These trends would continue into the Fatimid and Ayyubid periods. Politically, the Abbasid Caliphate evolved into an Islamic monarchy ( unitary system of government .) The regional Sultanate and Emirate governors' existence, validity, or legality were acknowledged for unity of the state. [104] In the early Islamic philosophy of the Iberian Umayyads , Averroes presented an argument in The Decisive Treatise , providing a justification for the emancipation of science and philosophy from official Ash'ari theology; thus, Averroism has been considered a precursor to modern secularism . [105] [106] Golden Baghdad Abbasids [ edit ] Early Middle Ages According to Arab sources in the year 750, Al-Saffah , the founder of the Abbasid Caliphate, launched a massive rebellion against the Umayyad Caliphate from the province of Khurasan near Talas. After eliminating the entire Umayyad family and achieving victory at the Battle of the Zab , Al-Saffah and his forces marched into Damascus and founded a new dynasty. His forces confronted many regional powers and consolidated the realm of the Abbasid Caliphate. [107] In Al-Mansur 's time, Persian scholarship emerged. Many non-Arabs converted to Islam. The Umayyads actively discouraged conversion in order to continue the collection of the jizya, or the tax on non-Muslims. Islam nearly doubled within its territory from 8% of residents in 750 to 15% by the end of Al-Mansur's reign. Al-Mahdi , whose name means \"Rightly-guided\" or \"Redeemer\", was proclaimed caliph when his father was on his deathbed. Baghdad blossomed during Al-Mahdi's reign, becoming the world's largest city. It attracted immigrants from Arabia, Iraq, Syria, Persia and as far away as India and Spain. Baghdad was home to Christians, Jews, Hindus, and Zoroastrians, in addition to the growing Muslim population. Like his father, Al-Hadi [108] was open to his people and allowed citizens to address him in the palace at Baghdad. He was considered an \"enlightened ruler\", and continued the policies of his Abbasid predecessors. His short rule was plagued by military conflicts and internal intrigue. An Arabic manuscript written under the second half of the Abbasid Era. The military conflicts subsided as Harun al-Rashid ruled. [109] His reign was marked by scientific, cultural and religious prosperity. He established the library Bayt al-Hikma (\"House of Wisdom\"), and the arts and music flourished during his reign. The Barmakid family played a decisive advisorial role in establishing the Caliphate, but declined during Rashid's rule. [110] Al-Amin received the Caliphate from his father Harun Al-Rashid, but failed to respect the arrangements made for his brothers, leading to the Fourth Fitna . Al-Ma'mun 's general Tahir ibn Husayn took Baghdad , executing Al-Amin. [111] The war led to a loss of prestige for the dynasty. Rise of regional powers [ edit ] Regional powers born out of the fragmentation of the Abbasid caliphate The Abbasids soon became caught in a three-way rivalry among Coptic Arabs, Indo-Persians , and immigrant Turks. [112] In addition, the cost of running a large empire became too great. [113] The Turks, Egyptians, and Arabs adhered to the Sunnite sect; the Persians, a great portion of the Turkic groups, and several of the princes in India were Shia. The political unity of Islam began to disintegrate. Under the influence of the Abbasid caliphs, independent dynasties appeared in the Muslim world and the caliphs recognized such dynasties as legitimately Muslim. The first was the Tahirid dynasty in Khorasan , which was founded during the caliph Al-Ma'mun 's reign. Similar dynasties included the Saffarids , Samanids , Ghaznavids and Seljuqs . During this time, advancements were made in the areas of astronomy, poetry, philosophy, science, and mathematics. [114] High Baghdad Abbasids [ edit ] Early Middle Ages Upon Al-Amin's death, Al-Ma'mun became Caliph. Al-Ma'mun extended the Abbasid empire's territory during his reign and dealt with rebellions. [115] Al-Ma'mun had been named governor of Khurasan by Harun, and after his ascension to power, the caliph named Tahir as governor of his military services in order to assure his loyalty. Tahir and his family became entrenched in Iranian politics and became powerful, frustrating Al-Ma'mun's desire to centralize and strengthen Caliphal power. The rising power of the Tahirid dynasty became a threat as Al-Ma'mun's own policies alienated them and other opponents. Al-Ma'mun worked to centralize power and ensure a smooth succession. Al-Mahdi proclaimed that the caliph was the protector of Islam against heresy, and also claimed the ability to declare orthodoxy. Religious scholars averred that Al-Ma'mun was overstepping his bounds in the Mihna , the Abbasid inquisition which he introduced in 833 four months before he died. [116] The Ulama emerged as a force in Islamic politics during Al-Ma'mun's reign for opposing the inquisitions. The Ulema and the major Islamic law schools took shape in the period of Al-Ma'mun. In parallel, Sunnism became defined as a religion of laws. Doctrinal differences between Sunni and Shi'a Islam became more pronounced. During the Al-Ma'mun regime, border wars increased. Al-Ma'mun made preparations for a major campaign, but died while leading an expedition in Sardis . Al-Ma'mun gathered scholars of many religions at Baghdad, whom he treated well and with tolerance. He sent an emissary to the Byzantine Empire to collect the most famous manuscripts there, and had them translated into Arabic. [117] His scientists originated alchemy . Shortly before his death, during a visit to Egypt in 832, the caliph ordered the breaching of the Great Pyramid of Giza to search for knowledge and treasure. Workers tunneled in near where tradition located the original entrance. Al-Ma'mun later died near Tarsus under questionable circumstances and was succeeded by his half-brother, Al-Mu'tasim , rather than his son, Al-Abbas ibn Al-Ma'mun. As Caliph, Al-Mu'tasim promptly ordered the dismantling of al-Ma'mun's military base at Tyana. He faced Khurramite revolts. One of the most difficult problems facing this Caliph was the ongoing uprising of Babak Khorramdin. Al-Mu'tasim overcame the rebels and secured a significant victory. Byzantine emperor Theophilus launched an attack against Abbasid fortresses. Al-Mu'tasim sent Al-Afshin, who met and defeated Theophilus' forces at the Battle of Anzen . On his return he became aware of a serious military conspiracy which forced him and his successors to rely upon Turkish commanders and ghilman slave-soldiers (foreshadowing the Mamluk system). The Khurramiyyah were never fully suppressed, although they slowly declined during the reigns of succeeding Caliphs. Near the end of al-Mu'tasim's life there was an uprising in Palestine, but he defeated the rebels. During Al-Mu'tasim's reign, the Tahirid dynasty continued to grow in power. The Tahirids were exempted from many tribute and oversight functions. Their independence contributed to Abbasid decline in the east. Ideologically, al-Mu'tasim followed his half-brother al-Ma'mun. He continued his predecessor's support for the Islamic Mu'tazila sect, applying brutal torture against the opposition. Arab mathematician Al-Kindi was employed by Al-Mu'tasim and tutored the Caliph's son. Al-Kindi had served at the House of Wisdom and continued his studies in Greek geometry and algebra under the caliph's patronage. [118] Al-Wathiq succeeded his father. Al-Wathiq dealt with opposition in Arabia, Syria, Palestine and in Baghdad. Using a famous sword he personally joined the execution of the Baghdad rebels. The revolts were the result of an increasingly large gap between Arab populations and the Turkish armies. The revolts were put down, but antagonism between the two groups grew, as Turkish forces gained power. He also secured a captive exchange with the Byzantines. Al-Wathiq was a patron of scholars, as well as artists. He personally had musical talent and is reputed to have composed over one hundred songs. [119] Minaret at the Great Mosque of Samarra . When Al-Wathiq died of high fever, Al-Mutawakkil succeeded him. Al-Mutawakkil's reign is remembered for many reforms and is viewed as a golden age. He was the last great Abbasid caliph; after his death the dynasty fell into decline. Al-Mutawakkil ended the Mihna. Al-Mutawakkil built the Great Mosque of Samarra [120] as part of an extension of Samarra eastwards. During his reign, Al-Mutawakkil met famous Byzantine theologian Constantine the Philosopher , who was sent to strengthen diplomatic relations between the Empire and the Caliphate by Emperor Michael III . Al-Mutawakkil involved himself in religious debates, as reflected in his actions against minorities. The Sh\u012b\u02bbi faced repression embodied in the destruction of the shrine of Hussayn ibn \u02bbAl\u012b , an action that was ostensibly carried out to stop pilgrimages. Al-Mutawakkil continued to rely on Turkish statesmen and slave soldiers to put down rebellions and lead battles against foreign empires, notably capturing Sicily from the Byzantines. Al-Mutawakkil was assassinated by a Turkish soldier. Al-Muntasir succeeded to the Caliphate on the same day with the support of the Turkish faction, though he was implicated in the murder. The Turkish party had al-Muntasir remove his brothers from the line of succession, fearing revenge for the murder of their father. Both brothers wrote statements of abdication. During his reign, Al-Muntasir removed the ban on pilgrimage to the tombs of Hassan and Hussayn and sent Wasif to raid the Byzantines. Al-Muntasir died of unknown causes. The Turkish chiefs held a council to select his successor, electing Al-Musta'in . The Arabs and western troops from Baghdad were displeased at the choice and attacked. However, the Caliphate no longer depended on Arabian choice, but depended on Turkish support. After the failed Muslim campaign against the Christians, people blamed the Turks for bringing disaster on the faith and murdering their Caliphs. After the Turks besieged Baghdad, Al-Musta'in planned to abdicate to Al-Mu'tazz but was put to death by his order. Al-Mu'tazz was enthroned by the Turks, becoming the youngest Abbasaid Caliph to assume power. High Abbasids Jurisprudence Four constructions of Islamite law Abu Hanifa (Iraq teacher) Malik bin Anas (Medina Imam) Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi`i (Egyptian Iman) Ahmad ibn Hanbal (Baghdad teacher) Early Abbasids Literature and Science Hunayn ibn Ishaq , physician, Greek translator; Ibn Fadlan , explorer; Al Battani , astronomer; Tabari , historian and theologian; Al-Razi , philosopher, medic, chemist; Al-Farabi , chemist and philosopher; Abu Nasr Mansur , mathematician; Alhazen , mathematician; Al-Biruni , mathematician, astronomer, physicist; Omar Khayy\u00e1m , poet, mathematician, and astronomer; Mansur Al-Hallaj , Sufism mystic, writer and teacher Al-Mu'tazz proved too apt a pupil of his Turkish masters, but was surrounded by parties jealous of each other. At Samarra , the Turks were having problems with the \"Westerns\" (Berbers and Moors ), while the Arabs and Persians at Baghdad, who had supported al-Musta'in, regarded both with equal hatred. Al-Mu'tazz put his brothers Al-Mu'eiyyad and Abu Ahmed to death. The ruler spent recklessly, causing a revolt of Turks, Africans, and Persians for their pay. Al-Mu'tazz was brutally deposed shortly thereafter. Al-Muhtadi became the next Caliph. He was firm and virtuous compared to the earlier Caliphs, though the Turks held the power. The Turks killed him soon after his ascension. Al-Mu'tamid followed, holding on for 23 years, though he was largely a ruler in name only. After the Zanj Rebellion , Al-Mu'tamid summoned al-Muwaffak to help him. Thereafter, Al-Muwaffaq ruled in all but name. The Hamdanid dynasty was founded by Hamdan ibn Hamdun when he was appointed governor of Mardin in Anatolia by the Caliphs in 890. Al-Mu'tamid later transferred authority to his son, al-Mu'tadid , and never regained power. The Tulunids became the first independent state in Islamic Egypt, when they broke away during this time. Al-Mu'tadid ably administered the Caliphate. Egypt returned to allegiance and Mesopotamia was restored to order. He was tolerant towards Shi'i, but toward the Umayyad community he was not so just. Al-Mu'tadid was cruel in his punishments, some of which are not surpassed by those of his predecessors. For example, the Kharijite leader at Mosul was paraded about Baghdad clothed in a robe of silk, of which Kharijites denounced as sinful, and then crucified. Upon Al-Mu'tadid's death, his son by a Turkish slave-girl, Al-Muktafi , succeeded to the throne. Al-Muktafi became a favorite of the people for his generosity, and for abolishing his father's secret prisons, the terror of Baghdad. During his reign, the Caliphate overcame threats such as the Carmathians . Upon Al-Muktafi's death, the vazir next chose Al-Muqtadir . Al-Muqtadir's reign was a constant succession of thirteen Vazirs, one rising on the fall or assassination of another. His long reign brought the Empire to its lowest ebb. Africa was lost, and Egypt nearly. Mosul threw off its dependence, and the Greeks raided across the undefended border. The East continued to formally recognise the Caliphate, including those who virtually claimed independence. At the end of the Early Baghdad Abbasids period, Empress Zoe Karbonopsina pressed for an armistice with Al-Muqtadir and arranged for the ransom of the Muslim prisoner [121] while the Byzantine frontier was threatened by Bulgarians. This only added to Baghdad's disorder. Though despised by the people, Al-Muqtadir was again placed in power after upheavals. Al-Muqtadir was eventually slain outside the city gates, whereupon courtiers chose his brother al-Qahir . He was even worse. Refusing to abdicate, he was blinded and cast into prison. His son Ar-Radi took over only to experience a cascade of misfortune. Praised for his piety, he became the tool of the de facto ruling Minister, Ibn Raik ( amir al-umara ; 'Amir of the Amirs'). Ibn Raik held the reins of government and his name was joined with the Caliph's in public prayers. Around this period, the Hanbalis , supported by popular sentiment, set up in fact a kind of 'Sunni inquisition'. Ar-Radi is commonly regarded as the last of the real Caliphs: the last to deliver orations at the Friday service, to hold assemblies, to commune with philosophers, to discuss the questions of the day, to take counsel on the affairs of State; to distribute alms , or to temper the severity of cruel officers. Thus ended the Early Baghdad Abbasids. In the late mid-930s, the Ikhshidids of Egypt carried the Arabic title \"Wali\" reflecting their position as governors on behalf of the Abbasids, The first governor ( Muhammad bin Tughj Al-Ikhshid ) was installed by the Abbasid Caliph. They gave him and his descendants the Wilayah for 30 years. The last name Ikhshid is Soghdian for \"prince\". Also in the 930s, \u2018Al\u012b ibn B\u016byah and his two younger brothers, al-Hassan and A\u1e25mad founded the B\u016byid confederation . Originally a soldier in the service of the Ziy\u0101r\u012bds of \u1e6cabarist\u0101n , \u2018Al\u012b was able to recruit an army to defeat a Turkish general from Baghdad named Y\u0101q\u016bt in 934. Over the next nine years the three brothers gained control of the remainder of the caliphate, while accepting the titular authority of the caliph in Baghdad. The B\u016byids made large territorial gains. Fars and Jibal were conquered. Central Iraq submitted in 945, before the B\u016byids took Kerm\u0101n (967), Oman (967), the Jaz\u012bra (979), \u1e6cabarist\u0101n (980), and Gorgan (981). After this the B\u016byids went into slow decline, with pieces of the confederation gradually breaking off and local dynasties under their rule becoming de facto independent. [122] Middle Baghdad Abbasids [ edit ] Early High Middle Ages Dirham of Al-Muttaqi At the beginning of the Middle Baghdad Abbasids, the Caliphate had become of little importance. The amir al-umara Bajkam contented himself with dispatching his secretary to Baghdad to assemble local dignitaries to elect a successor. The choice fell on Al-Muttaqi . Bajkam was killed on a hunting party by marauding Kurds. In the ensuing anarchy in Baghdad, Ibn Raik persuaded the Caliph to flee to Mosul where he was welcomed by the Hamdanids. They assassinated Ibn Raik. Hamdanid Nasir al-Dawla advanced on Baghdad, where mercenaries and well-organised Turks repelled them. Turkish general Tuzun became amir al-umara . The Turks were staunch Sunnis. A fresh conspiracy placed the Caliph in danger. Hamdanid troops helped ad-Daula escape to Mosul and then to Nasibin. Tuzun and the Hamdanid were stalemated. Al-Muttaqi was at Raqqa , moving to Tuzun where he was deposed. Tuzun installed the blinded Caliph's cousin as successor, with the title of Al-Mustakfi . With the new Caliph, Tuzun attacked the Buwayhid dynasty and the Hamdanids . Soon after, Tuzun died, and was succeeded by one of his generals, Abu Ja'far. The Buwayhids then attacked Baghdad, and Abu Ja'far fled into hiding with the Caliph. Buwayhid Sultan Muiz ud-Daula assumed command forcing the Caliph into abject submission to the Amir. Eventually, Al-Mustakfi was blinded and deposed. The city fell into chaos, and the Caliph's palace was looted. [123] Significant Middle Abbasid Muslims Ibn Rushd ( Averroes ), philosopher; al-Farabi , Persian (Soghdian) philosopher; Al-Mutanebbi , Arabic poet; Abu Ali Husain ibn Abdallah ibn Sina ( Avicenna ), physician, philosopher, and scientist Once the Buwayhids controlled Baghdad, Al-Muti became caliph. The office was shorn of real power and Shi'a observances were established. The Buwayhids held on Baghdad for over a century. Throughout the Buwayhid reign the Caliphate was at its lowest ebb, but was recognized religiously, except in Iberia . Buwayhid Sultan Mu'izz al-Dawla was prevented from raising a Shi'a Caliph to the throne by fear for his own safety, and fear of rebellion, in the capital and beyond. [124] The next Caliph, Al-Ta'i , reigned over factional strife in Syria among the Fatimids, Turks, and Carmathians. The Hideaway dynasyty also fractured. The Abbasid borders were the defended only by small border states. Baha' al-Dawla , the Buyid amir of Iraq, deposed al-Ta'i in 991 and proclaimed al-Qadir the new caliph. [125] During al-Qadir's Caliphate, Mahmud of Ghazni looked after the empire. Mahmud of Ghazni, of Eastern fame, was friendly towards the Caliphs, and his victories in the Indian Empire were accordingly announced from the pulpits of Baghdad in grateful and glowing terms. Al-Qadir fostered the Sunni struggle against Shi\u02bfism and outlawed heresies such as the Baghdad Manifesto and the doctrine that the Quran was created. He outlawed the Mu\u02bftazila , bringing an end to the development of rationalist Muslim philosophy. During this and the next period, Islamic literature , especially Persian literature , flourished under the patronage of the Buwayhids. [126] By 1000, the global Muslim population had climbed to about 4 percent of the world, compared to the Christian population of 10 percent. During Al-Qa'im 's reign, the Buwayhid ruler often fled the capital and the Seljuq dynasty gained power. Toghr\u00fcl overran Syria and Armenia. He then made his way into the Capital, where he was well-received both by chiefs and people. In Bahrain , the Qarmatian state collapsed in Al-Hasa . Arabia recovered from the Fatimids and again acknowledged the spiritual jurisdiction of the Abbasids. Al-Muqtadi was honored by the Seljuq Sultan Malik-Shah I , during whose reign the Caliphate was recognized throughout the extending range of Seljuq conquest. The Sultan was critical of the Caliph's interference in affairs of state, but died before deposing the last of the Middle Baghdad Abbasids. [127] Late Baghdad Abbasids [ edit ] Late High Middle Ages Al-Aqsa Mosque Plan of Al-Aqsa Mosque, year 985 Dome of Al Aqsa Mousque The Late Baghdad Abbasids reigned from the beginning of the Crusades to the Seventh Crusade . The first Caliph was Al-Mustazhir . He was politically irrelevant, despite civil strife at home and the First Crusade in Syria. Raymond IV of Toulouse attempted to attack Baghdad, losing at the Battle of Manzikert . The global Muslim population climbed to about 5 per cent as against the Christian population of 11 per cent by 1100. Jerusalem was captured by crusaders who massacred its inhabitants. Preachers travelled throughout the caliphate proclaiming the tragedy and rousing men to recover the Al-Aqsa Mosque from the Franks (European Crusaders). Crowds of exiles rallied for war against the infidel . Neither the Sultan nor the Caliph sent an army west. [128] Al-Mustarshid achieved more independence while the sultan Mahmud II of Great Seljuq was engaged in war in the East. The Banu Mazyad (Mazyadid State) general, Dubays ibn Sadaqa [129] (emir of Al-Hilla ), plundered Bosra and attacked Baghdad together with a young brother of the sultan, Ghiyath ad-Din Mas'ud . Dubays was crushed by a Seljuq army under Zengi , founder of the Zengid dynasty . Mahmud's death was followed by a civil war between his son Dawud, his nephew Mas'ud and the atabeg Toghrul II. Zengi was recalled to the East, stimulated by the Caliph and Dubays, where he was beaten. The Caliph then laid siege to Mosul for three months without success, resisted by Mas'ud and Zengi. It was nonetheless a milestone in the caliphate's military revival. [130] After the siege of Damascus (1134), [131] Zengi undertook operations in Syria . Al-Mustarshid attacked sultan Mas'ud of western Seljuq and was taken prisoner. He was later found murdered. [132] His son, Al-Rashid failed to gain independence from Seljuq Turks. Zengi, because of the murder of Dubays, set up a rival Sultanate. Mas'ud attacked; the Caliph and Zengi, hopeless of success, escaped to Mosul. The Sultan regained power, a council was held, the Caliph was deposed, and his uncle, son of Al-Muqtafi , appointed as the new Caliph. Ar-Rashid fled to Isfahan and was killed by Hashshashins. [133] Continued disunion and contests between Seljuq Turks allowed al-Muqtafi to maintain control in Baghdad and to extend it throughout Iraq. In 1139, al-Muqtafi granted protection to the Nestorian patriarch Abdisho III . While the Crusade raged, the Caliph successfully defended Baghdad against Muhammad II of Seljuq in the Siege of Baghdad (1157) . The Sultan and the Caliph dispatched men in response to Zengi's appeal, but neither the Seljuqs, nor the Caliph, nor their Amirs, dared resist the Crusaders. The next caliph, Al-Mustanjid , saw Saladin extinguish the Fatimid dynasty after 260 years, and thus the Abbasids again prevailed. Al-Mustadi reigned when Saladin become the sultan of Egypt and declared allegiance to the Abbasids. An-Nasir , \" The Victor for the Religion of God \", attempted to restore the Caliphate to its ancient dominant role. He consistently held Iraq from Tikrit to the Gulf without interruption. His forty-seven year reign was chiefly marked by ambitious and corrupt dealings with the Tartar chiefs, and by his hazardous invocation of the Mongols, which ended his dynasty. His son, Az-Zahir , was Caliph for a short period before his death and An-Nasir's grandson, Al-Mustansir , was made caliph. Al-Mustansir founded the Mustansiriya Madrasah . In 1236 \u00d6gedei Khan commanded to raise up Khorassan and populated Herat . The Mongol military governors mostly made their camp in Mughan plain , Azerbaijan. The rulers of Mosul and Cilician Armenia surrendered. Chormaqan divided the Transcaucasia region into three districts based on military hierarchy. [134] In Georgia, the population were temporarily divided into eight tumens . [135] By 1237 the Mongol Empire had subjugated most of Persia, excluding Abbasid Iraq and Ismaili strongholds, and all of Afghanistan and Kashmir . [136] Al-Musta'sim was the last Abbasid Caliph in Baghdad and is noted for his opposition to the rise of Shajar al-Durr to the Egyptian throne during the Seventh Crusade. To the east, Mongol forces under Hulagu Khan swept through the Transoxiana and Khorasan . Baghdad was sacked and the caliph deposed soon afterwards. The Mamluk sultans and Syria later appointed a powerless Abbasid Caliph in Cairo. Cairo Abbasid Caliphs [ edit ] Abbasid \"shadow\" caliph of Cairo Late Middle Ages The Abbasid \"shadow\" caliph of Cairo reigned under the tutelage of the Mamluk sultans and nominal rulers used to legitimize the actual rule of the Mamluk sultans. All the Cairene Abbasid caliphs who preceded or succeeded Al-Musta'in were spiritual heads lacking any temporal power. Al-Musta'in was the only Cairo-based Abbasid caliph to even briefly hold political power. Al-Mutawakkil III was the last \"shadow\" caliph. In 1517, Ottoman sultan Selim I defeated the Mamluk Sultanate, and made Egypt part of the Ottoman Empire. [137] [138] Fatimid Caliphate [ edit ] Main article: Fatimid Caliphate Fatimid caliphate The Fatimids originated in Ifriqiya (modern-day Tunisia and eastern Algeria ). The dynasty was founded in 909 by \u02bbAbdull\u0101h al-Mahd\u012b Billah , who legitimised his claim through descent from Muhammad by way of his daughter F\u0101tima as-Zahra and her husband \u02bbAl\u012b ibn-Ab\u012b-T\u0101lib , the first Sh\u012b\u02bba Im\u0101m , hence the name al-F\u0101timiyy\u016bn \"Fatimid\". [139] The Fatamids and the Zaydis at the time, used the Hanafi jurisprudence, as did most Sunnis. [140] [141] [142] Abdull\u0101h al-Mahdi's control soon extended over all of central Maghreb , an area consisting of the modern countries of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya, which he ruled from Mahdia , his capital in Tunisia. [143] The Fatimids entered Egypt in the late 10th century, conquering the Ikhshidid dynasty and founding a capital at al-Q\u0101hira ( Cairo ) in 969. [144] The name was a reference to the planet Mars, \"The Subduer\", which was prominent in the sky at the moment that city construction started. Cairo was intended as a royal enclosure for the Fatimid caliph and his army, though the actual administrative and economic capital of Egypt was in cities such as Fustat until 1169. After Egypt, the Fatimids continued to conquer surrounding areas until they ruled from Tunisia to Syria and even crossed the Mediterranean into Sicily and southern Italy. Under the Fatimids, Egypt became the center of an empire that included at its peak North Africa, Sicily, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, the Red Sea coast of Africa, Yemen and the Hejaz . [145] Egypt flourished, and the Fatimids developed an extensive trade network in both the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. Their trade and diplomatic ties extended all the way to China and its Song dynasty , which determined the economic course of Egypt during the High Middle Ages . Unlike other governments in the area, Fatimid advancement in state offices was based more on merit than heredity. Members of other branches of Islam, including Sunnis, were just as likely to be appointed to government posts as Shiites. Tolerance covered non-Muslims such as Christians and Jews; they took high levels in government based on ability. [146] There were, however, exceptions to this general attitude of tolerance, notably Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah . The Fatimid palace was in two parts. It was in the Khan el-Khalili area at Bin El-Quasryn street. [147] Fatimid caliphs [ edit ] Early and High Middle Ages Also see : Cairo Abbasid Caliphs (above) During the beginning of the Middle Baghdad Abbasids, the Fatimid Caliphs claimed spiritual supremacy not only in Egypt, but also contested the religious leadership of Syria. At the beginning of the Abbasid realm in Baghdad, the Alids faced severe persecution by the ruling party as they were a direct threat to the Caliphate. Owing to the Abbasid inquisitions, the forefathers opted for concealment of the Dawa's existence. Subsequently, they traveled towards the Iranian Plateau and distanced themselves from the epicenter of the political world. Al Mahdi's father, Al Husain al Mastoor returned to control the Dawa's affairs. He sent two Dai's to Yemen and Western Africa. Al Husain died soon after the birth of his son, Al Mahdi. A system of government helped update Al Mahdi on the development which took place in North Africa. [148] Al Mahdi Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah established the first Imam of the Fatimid dynasty. He claimed genealogic origins dating as far back as Fatimah through Husayn and Ismail. Al Mahdi established his headquarters at Salamiyah and moved towards north-western Africa, under Aghlabid rule. His success of laying claim to being the precursor to the Mahdi was instrumental among the Berber tribes of North Africa, specifically the Kutamah tribe. Al Mahdi established himself at the former Aghlabid residence at Raqqadah, a suburb of Al-Qayrawan in Tunisia. In 920, Al Mahdi took up residence at the newly established capital of the empire, Al-Mahdiyyah . After his death, Al Mahdi was succeeded by his son, Abu Al-Qasim Muhammad Al-Qaim, who continued his expansionist policy. [149] At the time of his death he had extended his reign to Morocco of the Idrisids , as well as Egypt itself.The Fatimid Caliphate grew to include Sicily and to stretch across North Africa from the Atlantic Ocean to Libya . [150] Abdull\u0101h al-Mahdi's control soon extended over all of central Maghreb , an area consisting of the modern countries of Morocco , Algeria , Tunisia , and Libya , which he ruled from Mahdia , in Tunisia. Newly built capital Al-Mansuriya , [a] or Mansuriyya ( Arabic : \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0635\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0647 \u200e), near Kairouan , Tunisia , was the capital of the Fatimid Caliphate during the rules of the Imams Al-Mansur Billah (r. 946\u2013953) and Al-Mu'izz li-Din Allah (r. 953\u2013975). The Fatimid general Jawhar conquered Egypt in 969, and he built a new palace city there, near Fus\u1e6d\u0101t, which he also called al-Man\u1e63\u016briyya. Under Al-Muizz Lideenillah , the Fatimids conquered the Ikhshidid Wilayah (see Fatimid Egypt ), founding a new capital at al-Q\u0101hira ( Cairo ) in 969. [144] The name was a reference to the planet Mars, \"The Subduer\", [152] which was prominent in the sky at the moment that city construction started. Cairo was intended as a royal enclosure for the Fatimid caliph and his army, though the actual administrative and economic capital of Egypt was in cities such as Fustat until 1169. After Egypt, the Fatimids continued to conquer the surrounding areas until they ruled from Tunisia to Syria , as well as Sicily . The Al-Hakim Mosque Cairo, Egypt; south of Bab Al-Futuh \"Islamic Cairo\" building was named after Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah , built by Fatimid vizier Gawhar Al-Siqilli , and extended by Badr al-Jamali . Under the Fatimids, Egypt became the center of an empire that included at its peak North Africa , Sicily, Palestine , Jordan , Lebanon , Syria, the Red Sea coast of Africa, Tihamah , Hejaz , and Yemen . [ citation needed ] Egypt flourished, and the Fatimids developed an extensive trade network in both the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. Their trade and diplomatic ties extended all the way to China and its Song Dynasty , which eventually determined the economic course of Egypt during the High Middle Ages . After the eighteenth Imam, al-Mustansir Billah , the Nizari sect believed that his son Nizar was his successor, while another Ism\u0101\u02bf\u012bl\u012b branch known as the Mustaali (from whom the Dawoodi Bohra would eventually descend), supported his other son, al-Musta'li . The Fatimid dynasty continued with al-Musta'li as both Imam and Caliph, and that joint position held until the 20th Imam, al-Amir bi-Ahkami l-Lah (1132 CE). At the death of Imam Amir, one branch of the Mustaali faith claimed that he had transferred the imamate to his son at-Tayyib Abi l-Qasim , who was then two years old. After the decay of the Fatimid political system in the 1160s, the Zengid ruler N\u016br ad-D\u012bn had his general, Shirkuh , seized Egypt from the vizier Shawar in 1169. Shirkuh died two months after taking power, and the rule went to his nephew, Saladin . [153] This began the Ayyubid Sultanate of Egypt and Syria . The Crusades [ edit ] Main article: The Crusades Saladin and Guy of Lusignan after the Battle of Hattin List of Crusades Early period \u00b7 First Crusade 1095\u20131099 \u00b7 Second Crusade 1147\u20131149 \u00b7 Third Crusade 1187\u20131192 Low Period \u00b7 Fourth Crusade 1202\u20131204 \u00b7 Fifth Crusade 1217\u20131221 \u00b7 Sixth Crusade 1228\u20131229 Late period \u00b7 Seventh Crusade 1248\u20131254 \u00b7 Eighth Crusade 1270 \u00b7 Ninth Crusade 1271\u20131272 Beginning in the 8th century, the Iberian Christian kingdoms had begun the Reconquista aimed at retaking Al-Andalus from the Moors. In 1095, Pope Urban II , inspired by the conquests in Spain by Christian forces and implored by the eastern Roman emperor to help defend Christianity in the East, called for the First Crusade from Western Europe which captured Edessa , Antioch , County of Tripoli and Jerusalem. [154] In the early period of the Crusades, the Christian Kingdom of Jerusalem emerged and for a time controlled Jerusalem. The Kingdom of Jerusalem and other smaller Crusader kingdoms over the next 90 years formed part of the complicated politics of the Levant , but did not threaten the Islamic Caliphate nor other powers in the region. After Shirkuh ended Fatimid rule in 1169, uniting it with Syria, the Crusader kingdoms were faced with a threat, and his nephew Saladin reconquered most of the area in 1187, leaving the Crusaders holding a few ports. [155] In the Third Crusade armies from Europe failed to recapture Jerusalem, though Crusader states lingered for several decades, and other crusades followed. The Christian Reconquista continued in Al-Andalus, and was eventually completed with the fall of Granada in 1492. During the low period of the Crusades, the Fourth Crusade was diverted from the Levant and instead took Constantinople , leaving the Eastern Roman Empire (now the Byzantine Empire) further weakened in their long struggle against the Turkish peoples to the east. However, the crusaders did manage to damage Islamic caliphates; according to William of Malmesbury , preventing them from further expansion into Christendom [156] and being targets of the Mamluks and the Mongols. See also: High Middle Ages , Frankokratia , and Crusader states Ayyubid dynasty [ edit ] Main article: Ayyubid dynasty Ayyubid empire The Ayyubid dynasty was founded by Saladin and centered in Egypt. In 1174, Saladin proclaimed himself Sultan and conquered the Near East region. The Ayyubids ruled much of the Middle East during the 12th and 13th centuries, controlling Egypt, Syria, northern Mesopotamia, Hejaz, Yemen, and the North African coast up to the borders of modern-day Tunisia. After Saladin, his sons contested control over the sultanate, but Saladin's brother al-Adil eventually established himself in 1200. In the 1230s, Syria's Ayyubid rulers attempted to win independence from Egypt and remained divided until Egyptian Sultan as-Salih Ayyub restored Ayyubid unity by taking over most of Syria, excluding Aleppo , by 1247. In 1250, the dynasty in the Egyptian region was overthrown by slave regiments. A number of attempts to recover it failed, led by an-Nasir Yusuf of Aleppo. In 1260, the Mongols sacked Aleppo and wrested control of what remained of the Ayyubid territories soon after. [157] Sultans of Egypt [ edit ] Sultans and Amirs of Damascus [ edit ] Emirs of Aleppo [ edit ] Mongol period [ edit ] Mongol invasions [ edit ] Main article: Mongol invasions and conquests The Mongol ruler, Ghazan , studying the Quran . After the Crusades the Mongols invaded in the 13th century, marking the end of the Islamic Golden Age . Some historians assert that the eastern Islamic world never fully recovered. Under the leadership of Genghis Khan , The Mongols put an end to the Abbasid era. The Mongol invasion of Central Asia began in 1219 at a huge cost in civilian life and economic devastation. The Mongols spread throughout Central Asia and Persia: the Persian city of Isfahan had fallen to them by 1237. [158] With the election of Khan Mongke in 1251, Mongol targeted the Abbasid capital, Baghdad. Mongke's brother, Hulegu , was made leader of the Mongol Army assigned to the task of subduing Baghdad. The fall of Bagdhad in 1258 destroyed what had been the largest city in Islam. The last Abbasid caliph, al-Musta'sim , was captured and killed; and Baghdad was ransacked and destroyed. The cities of Damascus and Aleppo fell in 1260. Plans for the conquest of Egypt were delayed due to the death of Mongke at around the same time. The Abbasid army lost to the superior Mongol army, but the invaders were finally stopped by Egyptian Mamluks north of Jerusalem in 1260 at the pivotal Battle of Ain Jalut . [159] Islamic Mongol empires [ edit ] Main articles: Ilkhanate , Golden Horde , and Timurid Empire Mosque of \u00d6z Beg Khan (the Muslim ruler of the Golden Horde). Ultimately, the Ilkhanate , Golden Horde , and the Chagatai Khanate - three of the four principal Mongol khanates - embraced Islam. [160] [161] [162] In power in Syria, Mesopotamia, Persia and further east, over the rest of the 13th century gradually all converted to Islam. Most Ilkhanid rulers were replaced by the new Mongol power founded by Timur (himself a Muslim), who conquered Persia in the 1360s, and moved against the Delhi Sultanate in India and the Ottoman Turks in Anatolia . Timur's ceaseless conquests were accompanied by displays of brutality matched only by Chinggis Khan , whose example Timur consciously imitated. [163] Samarqand , the cosmopolitan capital of Timur's empire, flourished under his rule as never before, while Iran and Iraq suffered large-scale devastation. [163] The Middle East was still recovering from the Black Death , which may have killed one third of the population in the region. The plague began in China, and reached Alexandria in Egypt in 1347, spreading over the following years to most Islamic areas. The combination of the plague and the wars left the Middle Eastern Islamic world in a seriously weakened position. The Timurid dynasty would found many branches of Islam, including the Mughals of India. [164] [165] Mamluk Sultanate [ edit ] Main article: Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo) Mamluk empire and Mongol Ilkhanate In 1250, the Ayyubid Egyptian dynasty was overthrown by slave regiments, and the Mamluk Sultanate was born. Military prestige was at the center of Mamluk society, and it played a key role in the confrontations with the Mongol forces. In the 1260s, the Mongols sacked and controlled the Islamic Near East territories. The Mamluks, who were Turkic , forced out the Mongols (see Battle of Ain Jalut ) after the final destruction of the Ayyubid dynasty. The Mongols were again defeated by the Mamluks at the Battle of Hims a few months later, and then driven out of Syria altogether. [100] With this, the Mamluks were able to concentrate their forces and to conquer the last of the crusader territories in the Levant. Thus they united Syria and Egypt for the longest interval between the Abbasid and Ottoman empires (1250\u20131517). [166] The Mamluks experienced a continual state of political conflict, military tension, proxy wars, and economic competition between the \"Muslim territory\" ( Dar al-Islam ) and \"non-Muslim territory\" ( Dar al-Harb ). [167] As part of their chosen role as defenders of Islamic orthodoxy, the Mamluks sponsored many religious buildings, including mosques, madrasas and khanqahs . Though some construction took place in the provinces, the vast bulk of these projects expanded the capital. Many Mamluk buildings in Cairo have survived to this day, particularly in Old Cairo. [168] Bahri Sultans [ edit ] Main article: Bahri dynasty Burji Sultans [ edit ] Main article: Burji dynasty See also : Islamic Egypt governors, Mamluks Era Al-Andalus [ edit ] The interiors of the Alhambra in Granada , Spain decorated with arabesque designs. Main articles: Umayyad conquest of Hispania , Al-Andalus , and Taifa The Arabs, under the command of the Berber General Tarik ibn Ziyad , first began their conquest of southern Spain or al-Andalus in 711. A raiding party led by Tarik was sent to intervene in a civil war in the Visigothic kingdom in Hispania . Crossing the Strait of Gibraltar (named after the General), it won a decisive victory in the summer of 711 when the Visigothic king Roderic was defeated and killed on July 19 at the Battle of Guadalete . Tariq's commander, Musa bin Nusair crossed with substantial reinforcements, and by 718 the Muslims dominated most of the peninsula. Some later Arabic and Christian sources present an earlier raid by a certain \u1e6c\u0101rif in 710 and also, the Ad Sebastianum recension of the Chronicle of Alfonso III , refers to an Arab attack incited by Erwig during the reign of Wamba (672\u201380). The two large armies may have been in the south for a year before the decisive battle was fought. [169] The rulers of Al-Andalus were granted the rank of Emir by the Umayyad Caliph Al-Walid I in Damascus . After the Abbasids came to power, some Umayyads fled to Muslim Spain to establish themselves there. By the end of the 10th century, the ruler Abd al-Rahman III took over the title of Caliph of C\u00f3rdoba (912-961). [170] Soon after, the Umayyads went on developing a strengthened state with its capital as C\u00f3rdoba . Al-Hakam II succeeded to the Caliphate after the death of his father Abd ar-Rahman III in 961. He secured peace with the Christian kingdoms of northern Iberia, [171] and made use of the stability to develop agriculture through the construction of irrigation works. [172] Economic development was also encouraged through the widening of streets and the building of markets. The rule of the Caliphate is known as the heyday of Muslim presence in the peninsula. [173] The Umayyad Caliphate collapsed in 1031 due to political divisions and civil unrest during the rule of Hicham II who was ousted because of his indolence. [174] Al-Andalus then broke up into a number of states called taifa kingdoms (Arabic, Muluk al-\u1e6daw\u0101'if ; English, Petty kingdoms). The decomposition of the Caliphate into those petty kingdoms weakened the Muslims in the Iberian Peninsula vis-\u00e0-vis the Christian kingdoms of the north. Some of the taifas , such as that of Seville, were forced to enter into alliances with Christian princes and pay tributes in money to Castille. [175] See also: Reconquista and Timeline of the Muslim presence in the Iberian peninsula Emirs of Al-Andalus [ edit ] Main article: Emirs of C\u00f3rdoba Abd al-Rahman I and Bedr (a former Greek slave) escaped with their lives after the popular revolt known as the Abbasid Revolution . Rahman I continued south through Palestine, the Sinai, and then into Egypt. Rahman I was one of several surviving Umayyad family members to make a perilous trek to Ifriqiya at this time. Rahman I and Bedr reached modern day Morocco near Ceuta . Next step would be to cross to sea to al-Andalus, where Rahman I could not have been sure whether he would be welcome. Following the Berber Revolt (740s), the province was in a state of confusion, with the Ummah torn by tribal dissensions among the Arabs and racial tensions between the Arabs and Berbers. Bedr lined up three Syrian commanders \u2013 Obeid Allah ibn Uthman and Abd Allah ibn Khalid , both originally of Damascus, and Yusuf ibn Bukht of Qinnasrin and contacted al-Sumayl (then in Zaragoza ) to get his consent, but al-Sumayl refused, fearing Rahman I would try to make himself emir. After discussion with Yemenite commanders, Rahman I was told to go to al-Andalus. Shortly thereafter, he set off with Bedr and a small group of followers for Europe. Abd al-Rahman landed at Almu\u00f1\u00e9car in al-Andalus, to the east of M\u00e1laga . During his brief time in M\u00e1laga, he quickly amassed local support. News of the prince's arrival spread throughout the peninsula. In order to help speed his ascension to power, he took advantage of the feuds and dissensions. However, before anything could be done, trouble broke out in northern al-Andalus. Abd al-Rahman and his followers were able to control Zaragoza . Rahman I fought to rule al-Andalus in a battle at the Guadalquivir river , just outside C\u00f3rdoba on the plains of Musarah (Battle of Musarah). Rahman I was victorious, chasing his enemies from the field with parts of their army. Rahman I marched into the capital, C\u00f3rdoba, fighting off a counterattack , but negotiations ended the confrontation. After Rahman I consolidated power, he proclaimed himself the al-Andalus emir. Rahman I did not claim the Muslim caliph, though. [176] The last step was to have al-Fihri's general, al-Sumayl, garroted in C\u00f3rdoba's jail. Al-Andalus was a safe haven for the house of Umayya that managed to evade the Abbasids. [177] In Baghdad, the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur had planned to depose the emir. Rahman I and his army confronted the Abbasids, killing most of the Abbasid army. The main Abbasid leaders were decapitated, their heads preserved in salt, with identifying tags pinned to their ears. The heads were bundled in a gruesome package and sent to the Abbasid caliph who was on pilgrimage at Mecca. Rahman I quelled repeated rebellions in al-Andalus. He began the building of the great mosque [cordova], and formed ship-yards along the coast; he is moreover said to have been the first to transplant the palm and the pomegranate into the congenial climate of Spain: and he encouraged science and literature in his states. He died on 29 September 788, after a reign of thirty-four years and one month. [178] The exterior of the Mezquita. Rahman I's successor was his son Hisham I . Born in C\u00f3rdoba, he built many mosques and completed the Mezquita . He called for a jihad that resulted in a campaign against the Kingdom of Asturias and the County of Toulouse ; in this second campaign he was defeated at Orange by William of Gellone , first cousin to Charlemagne . His successor Al-Hakam I came to power and was challenged by his uncles, other sons of Rahman I. One, Abdallah, went to the court of Charlemagne in Aix-la-Chapelle to negotiate for aid. In the mean time C\u00f3rdoba was attacked, but was defended. Hakam I spent much of his reign suppressing rebellions in Toledo, Saragossa and M\u00e9rida. [179] Abd ar-Rahman II succeeded his father and engaged in nearly continuous warfare against Alfonso II of Asturias , whose southward advance he halted. Rahman II repulsed an assault by Vikings who had disembarked in C\u00e1diz , conquered Seville (with the exception of its citadel ) and attacked C\u00f3rdoba. Thereafter he constructed a fleet and naval arsenal at Seville to repel future raids. He responded to William of Septimania 's requests of assistance in his struggle against Charles the Bald 's nominations. [180] Muhammad I 's reign was marked by the movements of the Muladi (ethnic Iberian Muslims) and Mozarabs (Muslim-Iberia Christians). Muhammad I was succeeded by his son Mundhir I . During the reign of his father, Mundhir I commanded military operations against the neighbouring Christian kingdoms and the Muladi rebellions. At his father's death, he inherited the throne. During his two-year reign, Mundhir I fought against Umar ibn Hafsun . He died in 888 at Bobastro, succeeded by his brother Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Umawi . Umawi showed no reluctance to dispose of those he viewed as a threat. His government was marked by continuous wars between Arabs, Berbers and Muladi. His power as emir was confined to the area of C\u00f3rdoba, while the rest had been seized by rebel families. The son he had designated as successor was killed by one of Umawi's brothers. The latter was in turn executed by Umawi's father, who named as successor Abd ar-Rahman III , son of the killed son of Umawi.

By 640 the Arabs controlled Mesopotamia , had invaded Armenia , and were concluding their conquest of Byzantine Syria . Damascus was the seat of the Umayyad caliphate . By the end of 641 all of Egypt was in Arab hands. Maghreb [ edit ] Main article: Greater Maghreb The Great Mosque of Kairouan also known as the Mosque of Uqba was established in 670 by the Arab general and conqueror Uqba ibn Nafi, it is the oldest mosque in the Maghreb, situated in the city of Kairouan , Tunisia . Kairouan in Tunisia was the first city founded by Muslims in the Maghreb . Arab general Uqba ibn Nafi erected the city (in 670) and, in the same time, the Great Mosque of Kairouan [184] considered as the oldest and most prestigious sanctuary in the western Islamic world. [185] This part of Islamic territory has had independent governments during most of Islamic history. The Idrisid were the first Arab rulers in the western Maghreb (Morocco), ruling from 788 to 985. The dynasty is named after its first sultan Idris I . [186] The Almoravid dynasty was a Berber dynasty from the Sahara flourished over a wide area of North-Western Africa and the Iberian Peninsula during the 11th century. Under this dynasty the Moorish empire was extended over present-day Morocco, Western Sahara, Mauritania, Gibraltar, Tlemcen (in Algeria) and a part of what is now Senegal and Mali in the south, and Spain and Portugal in the north. [187] The Almohad Dynasty or \"the Unitarians\", were a Berber Muslim religious power which founded the fifth Moorish dynasty in the 12th century, and conquered all Northern Africa as far as Egypt, together with Al-Andalus. [188] Horn of Africa [ edit ] Main articles: Islam in Ethiopia and Islam in Somalia The history of Islam in the Horn of Africa is almost as old as the faith itself. Through extensive trade and social interactions with their converted Muslim trading partners on the other side of the Red Sea , in the Arabian peninsula , merchants and sailors in the Horn region gradually came under the influence of the new religion. [189] Early Islamic disciples fled to the port city of Zeila in modern-day northern Somalia to seek protection from the Quraysh at the court of the Aksumite Emperor in present-day Somalia. Some of the Muslims that were granted protection are said to have then settled in several parts of the Horn region to promote the religion. The victory of the Muslims over the Quraysh in the 7th century had a significant impact on local merchants and sailors, as their trading partners in Arabia had by then all adopted Islam, and the major trading routes in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea came under the sway of the Muslim Caliphs . Instability in the Arabian peninsula saw further migrations of early Muslim families to the Somali seaboard. These clans came to serve as catalysts, forwarding the faith to large parts of the Horn region. [189] Great Lakes [ edit ] Islam came to the Great Lakes region of South Eastern Africa along existing trade routes. [190] They learned from them the manners of the Muslims and this led to their conversion by the Muslim Arabs. Local Islamic governments centered in Tanzania (then Zanzibar ). The people of Zayd were Muslims that immigrated to the Great Lakes region. In the pre-colonial period, the structure of Islamic authority here was held up through the Ulema ( wanawyuonis , in Swahili language ). These leaders had some degree of authority over most of the Muslims in South East Africa before territorial boundaries were established. The chief Qadi there was recognized for having the final religious authority. [191] Islam in East and South Asia [ edit ] Southeast Asia [ edit ] See also: The spread of Islam in Indonesia (1200 to 1600) Islam first reached Maritime Southeast Asia through traders from Mecca in the 7th century CE, [100] particularly via the western part of what is now Indonesia . Arab traders from Yemen already had a presence in Asia through trading and traveling by sea, serving as intermediary traders to and from Europe and Africa. They traded not only Arabian goods but also goods from Africa, India, and so on which included ivory, fragrances, spices, and gold. [192] According to T.W. Arnold in The Preaching of Islam , by the 2nd century of the Islamic Calendar, Arab traders had been trading with the inhabitants of Ceylon , modern-day Sri Lanka. The same argument has been told by Dr. B.H. Burger and Dr. Mr. Prajudi in Sedjarah Ekonomis Sosiologis Indonesia (History of Socio Economic of Indonesia) [193] According to an atlas created by the geographer Al-Biruni (973\u20131048), the Indian or Indonesian Ocean used to be called the Persian Ocean. After Western Imperialist rule, this name was changed to reflect the name used today; the Indian Ocean. [194] Soon, many Sufi missionaries translated classical Sufi literature from Arabic and Persian into Malay ; a tangible product of this is the Jawi script . Coupled with the composing of original Islamic literature in Malay, this led the way to the transformation of Malay into an Islamic language. [195] By 1292, when Marco Polo visited Sumatra, most of the inhabitants had converted to Islam. The Sultanate of Malacca was founded on the Malay Peninsula by Parameswara , a Srivijayan Prince. Through trade and commerce, Islam then spread to Borneo and Java . By the late 15th century, Islam had been introduced to the Philippines via the southern island of Mindanao . [196] The foremost [ citation needed ] socio-cultural Muslim entities that resulted form this are the present-day Sultanate of Sulu and Sultanate of Maguindanao ; Islamised kingdoms in the northern Luzon island, such as the Kingdom of Maynila and the Kingdom of Tondo , were later conquered and Christianised with the majority of the archipelago by Spanish colonisers beginning in the 16th century. As Islam spread, societal changes developed from the individual conversions, and five centuries later it emerged as a dominant cultural and political power in the region. Three main Muslim political powers emerged. The Aceh Sultanate was the most important, controlling much of the area between Southeast Asia and India from its centre in northern Sumatra . The Sultanate also attracted Sufi poets . The second Muslim power was the Sultanate of Malacca on the Malay Peninsula. The Sultanate of Demak on Java was the third power, where the emerging Muslim forces defeated the local Majapahit kingdom in the early 16th century. [197] Although the sultanate managed to expand its territory somewhat, its rule remained brief. [100] Portuguese forces captured Malacca in 1511 under naval general Afonso de Albuquerque . With Malacca subdued, the Aceh Sultanate and Bruneian Empire established themselves as centres of Islam in Southeast Asia. The Sultanate's territory, although vastly diminished, remains intact to this day as the modern state of Brunei Darussalam . [100] Indian Subcontinent [ edit ] Main article: Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent Qutub Minar and Alai Gate were built during Mamluk and Khalji dynasty periods of Delhi Sultanate. [198] On the Indian subcontinent , Islam first appeared in the southwestern tip of the peninsula, in today's Kerala state. Arabs traded with Malabar even before the birth of Muhammad. Native legends say that a group of Sahaba , under Malik Ibn Deenar , arrived on the Malabar Coast and preached Islam. According to that legend, the first mosque of India was built by Second Chera King Cheraman Perumal , who accepted Islam and received the name Tajudheen . He traveled to Arabia to meet Muhammad and died on the trip back, somewhere in today's Oman . Historical records suggest that the Cheraman Perumal Mosque was built in around 629. [199] Islamic rule came to the Indian subcontinent in the 8th century, when Muhammad bin Qasim conquered Sindh . Muslim conquests expanded under Mahmud and the Ghaznavids until the late 12th century, when the Ghurids overran the Ghaznavids and extended the conquests in Northern India. Qutb-ud-din Aybak conquered Delhi in 1206 and began the reign of the Delhi Sultanates . [200] In the 14th century, Alauddin Khalji extended Muslim rule south to Gujarat , Rajasthan and Deccan . Various other Muslim dynasties also formed and ruled across India from the 13th to the 18th century such as the Qutb Shahi and the Bahmani , but none rivalled the power and extensive reach of the Mughal Empire at its peak. [201] China [ edit ] Further information: History of Islam in China In China, four Sahabas (Sa'ad ibn abi Waqqas, Wahb Abu Kabcha, Jafar ibn Abu Talib and Jahsh ) preached in 616/17 and onwards after following the Chittagong \u2013 Kamrup \u2013 Manipur route after sailing from Abyssinia in 615/16. After conquering Persia in 636, Sa'ad ibn abi Waqqas went with Sa'id ibn Zaid , Qais ibn Sa'd and Hassan ibn Thabit to China in 637 taking the complete Quran. Sa'ad ibn abi Waqqas headed for China for the third time in 650\u201351 after Caliph Uthman asked him to lead an embassy to China, which the Chinese emperor received. [202] Early Modern period [ edit ] Main article: Early modern history In the 15th and 16th centuries three major Muslim empires formed: the Ottoman Empire in the Middle East, the Balkans and Northern Africa ; the Safavid Empire in Greater Iran ; and the Mughal Empire in South Asia. These imperial powers were made possible by the discovery and exploitation of gunpowder and more efficient administration. [203] Ottoman Empire [ edit ] Main article: Ottoman Empire The Ottoman Empire at its greatest extent in the Middle East. The Seljuq Turks declined in the second half of the 13th century, after the Mongol invasion . [204] This resulted in the establishment of multiple Turkish principalities, known as beyliks . Osman I , the founder of the Ottoman dynasty , assumed leadership of one of these principalities ( S\u00f6\u011f\u00fct ) at the end of the thirteenth century, succeeding his father Ertu\u011frul . Osman I afterwards led it in a series of battles with the Byzantine Empire. [205] By 1331, the Ottomans had captured Nicaea , the former Byzantine capital, under the leadership of Osman's son and successor, Orhan I . [206] Victory at the Battle of Kosovo against the Serbs in 1389 then facilitated their expansion into Europe. The Ottomans were established in the Balkans and Anatolia by the time Bayezid I ascended to power in the same year, now at the helm of a growing empire. [207] Growth halted when Mongol warlord Timur (also known as \" Tamerlane \") captured Bayezid I in the Battle of Ankara in 1402, beginning the Ottoman Interregnum . This episode was characterized by the division of the Ottoman territory amongst Bayezid I's sons, who submitted to Timurid authority. When a number of Ottoman territories regained independent status, ruin for the Empire loomed. However, the empire recovered, as the youngest son of Bayezid I, Mehmed I , waged offensive campaigns against his ruling brothers, thereby reuniting Asia Minor and declaring himself sultan in 1413. [100] Around this time the Ottoman naval fleet developed, such that they were able to challenge Venice , a naval power . They also attempted to reconquer the Balkans. By the time of Mehmed I's grandson, Mehmed II (ruled 1444\u20131446; 1451\u20131481), the Ottomans could lay siege to Constantinople , the capital of Byzantium. A factor in this siege was the use of muskets and large cannons introduced by the Ottomans. The Byzantine fortress succumbed in 1453, after 54 days of siege. Without its capital the Byzantine Empire disintegrated. [100] The future successes of the Ottomans and later empires would depend upon the exploitation of gunpowder . [203] The Suleiman Mosque (S\u00fcleymaniye Camii) in Istanbul was built on the order of sultan Suleiman the Magnificent by the Ottoman architect Mimar Sinan in 1557 In the early 16th century, the Shi'ite Safavid dynasty assumed control in Persia under the leadership of Shah Ismail I , defeating the ruling Turcoman federation Aq Qoyunlu (also called the \"White Sheep Turkomans\") in 1501. The Ottoman sultan Selim I sought to repel Safavid expansion, challenging and defeating them at the Battle of Chaldiran in 1514. Selim I also deposed the ruling Mamluks in Egypt, absorbing their territories in 1517. Suleiman I (also known as Suleiman the Magnificent ), Selim I's successor, took advantage of the diversion of Safavid focus to the Uzbeks on the eastern frontier and recaptured Baghdad, which had fallen under Safavid control. Despite this, Safavid power remained substantial, rivalling the Ottomans. Suleiman I advanced deep into Hungary following the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1526 \u2014 reaching as far as the gates of Vienna thereafter, and signed a Franco-Ottoman alliance with Francis I of France against Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire 10 years later. While Suleiman I's rule (1520\u20131566) is often identified as the apex of Ottoman power, the empire continued to remain powerful and influential until a relative fall in its military strength in the second half of the eighteenth century. [208] Safavid Empire [ edit ] Main article: Safavids Safavid empire The Safavid dynasty rose to power in Tabriz in 1501 and later conquered the rest of Iran. The Safavids were originally Sufi and Iran was Sunni. [209] After their defeat at the hands of the Sunni Ottomans at the Battle of Chaldiran , to unite the Persians behind him Ismail I made conversion mandatory for the largely Sunni population to Twelver Shia so that he could get them to fight the Sunni Ottomans. [210] This resulted in the Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam . Zaydis , the largest group amongst the Shia before the Safavid Dynasty were also forced to convert to the Twelver Shia. The Zaydis at that time used the Hanafi Fiqh, as did most Sunnis and there were good relations between them. Abu Hanifah and Zayd ibn Ali were also very good friends. [140] [141] [142] The Safavids dynasty from Azarbaijan ruled from 1501 to 1736, and which established Twelver Shi'a Islam as the region's official religion and united its provinces under a single sovereignty, thereby reigniting the Persian identity. Although claiming to be the descendants of Ali ibn Abu Talib , the Safavids were Sunni (the name \"Safavid\" comes from a Sufi order called Safavi ). Their origins go back to Firuz Shah Zarrinkolah , a local dignitary from the north. During their rule, the Safavids recognized Twelver Shi'a Islam as the State religion, thus giving the region a separate identity from its Sunni neighbours. Shah Suleiman I and his courtiers, Isfahan , 1670. Painter is Ali Qoli Jabbador , and is kept at The St. Petersburg Institute of Oriental Studies in Russia, ever since it was acquired by Tsar Nicholas II . Note the two Georgian figures with their names at the top left. In 1524, Tahmasp I acceded to the throne, initiating a revival of the arts. Carpetmaking became a major industry. The tradition of Persian miniature painting in manuscripts reached its peak, until Tahmasp turned to strict religious observance in middle age, prohibiting the consumption of alcohol and hashish and removing casinos , taverns and brothels . Tahmasp's nephew Ibrahim Mirza continued to patronize a last flowering of the arts until he was murdered, after which many artists were recruited by the Mughal dynasty. Tahmasp's grandson, Shah Abbas I , restored the shrine of the eighth Twelver Shi'a Imam, Ali al-Ridha at Mashhad , and restored the dynastic shrine at Ardabil . Both shrines received jewelry, fine manuscripts and Chinese porcelains. Abbas moved the capital to Isfahan , revived old ports, and established thriving trade with Europeans. Amongst Abbas's most visible cultural achievements was the construction of Naqsh-e Jahan Square (\"Design of the World\"). The plaza, located near a Friday mosque, covered 20 acres (81,000\u00a0m 2 ). [211] The Safavid Dynasty was toppled in 1722 by the Hotaki dynasty , which ended their forceful conversion of Sunni areas to Shiaism. Mughal Empire [ edit ] Mughal empire Main article: Mughal Empire The Mughal Empire was a product of various Central Asian invasions into the Indian subcontinent . It was founded by the Timurid prince Babur in 1526 with the destruction of the Delhi sultanate , placing its capital in Agra . Babur's death some years later and the indecisive rule of his son, Humayun , brought instability to Mughal rule. The resistance of the Afghani Sher Shah , who administered a string of defeats to Humayun, weakened the empire. A year before his death, however, Humayun managed to recover much of the lost territories, leaving a substantial legacy for his son, the 13-year-old Akbar (later known as Akbar the Great ), in 1556. Under Akbar, consolidation of the Mughal Empire occurred through both expansion and administrative reforms. After Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan came to power. Subsequently, Aurangazeb ruled vast areas including Afghanisthan, Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. [100] [212] The Taj Mahal The empire ruled most of present-day India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan for several centuries. Its decline in the early 18th century allowed India to be divided into smaller kingdoms and states. The Mughal dynasty was dissolved by the British Empire after the Indian rebellion of 1857 . [100] [212] It left a lasting legacy on Indian culture and architecture. Famous buildings built by the Mughals, include: the Taj Mahal , the Red Fort , the Badshahi Mosque , the Lahore Fort , the Shalimar Gardens and the Agra Fort . During the empire's reign, Muslim communities flourished all over India, in Gujarat , Bengal and Hyderabad . Various Sufi orders from Afghanistan and Persia were active throughout the region. More than a quarter of the population converted to Islam. [212] Modern period [ edit ] The modern age brought technological and organizational changes to Europe while the Islamic region continued the patterns of earlier centuries. The European powers, and especially Britain and France , globalized economically and colonized much of the region. Ottoman Empire partition [ edit ] Main article: Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire Ottoman army in World War I By the end of the 19th century, the Ottoman Empire had declined. The decision to back Germany in World War I meant they shared the Central Powers ' defeat in that war. The defeat led to the overthrow of the Ottomans by Turkish nationalists led by the victorious general of the Battle of Gallipoli : Mustafa Kemal , who became known to his people as Atat\u00fcrk, \"Father of the Turks.\" Atat\u00fcrk was credited with renegotiating the treaty of S\u00e8vres (1920) which ended Turkey's involvement in the war and establishing the modern Republic of Turkey , which was recognized by the Allies in the Treaty of Lausanne (1923). Atat\u00fcrk went on to implement an ambitious program of modernization that emphasized economic development and secularization . He transformed Turkish culture to reflect European laws, adopted Hindu - Arabic numerals , the Latin script , separated the religious establishment from the state, and emancipated woman\u2014even giving them the right to vote in parallel with women's suffrage in the west. [213] Following World War I, the vast majority of former Ottoman territory outside of Asia Minor was handed over to the victorious European powers as protectorates . During the war the Allies had promised the subject peoples independence in exchange for their assistance fighting the Turkish powers. To their dismay, they found that this system of \"protectorates\" was a smoke-screen for their continued subjugation by the British and the French. The struggles for independence from their Turkish overlords and the cooperation of partisan forces with the British were romanticized in the stories of British secret intelligence agent T. E. Lawrence \u2014later known as \"Lawrence of Arabia.\" [214] Ottoman successor states include today's Albania , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Bulgaria , Egypt, Greece, Iraq, Israel , Lebanon, Romania , Saudi Arabia , Serbia , Syria , Jordan , Turkey, Balkan states, North Africa and the north shore of the Black Sea . [215] Many Muslim countries sought to adopt European political organization and nationalism began to emerge in the Muslim world. Countries like Egypt, Syria and Turkey organized their governments and sought to develop national pride among their citizens. Other places, like Iraq, were not as successful due to a lack of unity and an inability to resolve age-old prejudices between Muslim sects and against non-Muslims. Some Muslim countries, such as Turkey and Egypt, sought to separate Islam from the secular government. In other cases, such as Saudi Arabia, the government brought out religious expression in the re-emergence of the puritanical form of Sunni Islam known to its detractors as Wahabism , which found its way into the Saudi royal family . See also: Ottoman Caliphate and Turkish War of Independence Arab\u2013Israeli conflict [ edit ] Main article: Arab\u2013Israeli conflict The Arab\u2013Israeli conflict spans about a century of political tensions and open hostilities. It involves the establishment of the modern State of Israel as a Jewish nation state , the consequent displacement of the Palestinian people and Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries , as well as the adverse relationship between the Arab states and the State of Israel (see related Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict ). Despite at first involving only the Arab states bordering Israel, animosity has also developed between Israel and other predominantly Muslim states . The Six-Day War of June 5\u201310, 1967, was fought between Israel and the neighbouring states of Egypt, Jordan, and Syria. The Arab countries closed the Suez canal and it was followed in May 1970 by the closure of the \"tapline\" from Saudi Arabia through Syria to Lebanon. These developments had the effect of increasing the importance of petroleum in Libya , which is a short (and canal-free) shipping distance from Europe. In 1970, Occidental Petroleum broke with other oil companies and accepted the Arab demands for price increases. Many countries, individuals and non-governmental organizations elsewhere in the world feel involved in this conflict for reasons such as cultural and religious ties with Islam, Arab culture , Christianity , Judaism , Jewish culture , or for ideological, human rights , or strategic reasons. Although some consider the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict a part of (or a precursor to) a wider clash of civilizations between the Western World and the Muslim world , [216] [217] others oppose this view. [218] Animosity emanating from this conflict has caused numerous attacks on supporters (or perceived supporters) of each side by supporters of the other side in many countries around the world. Other Islamic affairs [ edit ] Modern Islamic world Islam in the modern world Sunni countries Shia countries Ibadi countries In 1979 the Iranian Revolution transformed Iran from a constitutional monarchy to a populist theocratic Islamic republic under the rule of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , a Shi'i Muslim cleric and marja . Following the Revolution, and a new constitution was approved and a referendum established the government, electing Ruhollah Khomeini as Supreme Leader . During the following two years, liberals, leftists, and Islamic groups fought each other, and the Islamics captured power. The development of the two opposite fringes, the Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam the Twelver Shia version and its reinforcement by the Iranian Revolution and the Salafi in Saudi Arabia, coupled with the Iran\u2013Saudi Arabia relations resulted in these governments using sectarian conflict to enhance their political interests. [219] [220] Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait (despite being hostile to Iraq) encouraged Saddam Hussein to invade Iran, [221] which resulted in the Iran\u2013Iraq War , as they feared that an Islamic revolution would take place within their own borders. Certain Iranian exiles also helped convince Saddam that if he invaded, the fledgling Islamic republic would quickly collapse. In October 1973, a new war between Israel and its Muslim neighbors, known as the Yom Kippur War , broke out just as the oil companies began meeting with OPEC leaders. OPEC had been emboldened by the success of Sadat's campaigns and the war strengthened their unity. In response to the emergency resupply effort by the West that enabled Israel to put up a resistance against the Egyptian and Syrian forces, the Arab world imposed the 1973 oil embargo against the United States and Western Europe. Faisal agreed that Saudi Arabia would use some of its oil wealth to finance the \"front-line states\", those that bordered Israel, in their struggle. The centrality of petroleum, the Arab-Israeli Conflict and political and economic instability and uncertainty remain constant features of the politics of the region.

Mountainous regions of Iran were brought under a tighter grip of the central Abbasid government, as were areas of Turkestan.

Al-Ma'mun introduced the Mihna with the intention to centralize religious power in the caliphal institution and test the loyalty of his subjects. The Mihna had to be undergone by elites, scholars, judges and other government officials, and consisted of a series of questions relating to theology and faith. The central question was about the state of the creation of the Qur'an: if the person interrogated stated he believed the Qur'an to be created, he was free to leave and continue his profession.

In the past fifty years, scholars have frequently tended to view this decreasing participation of the sultan in political life as evidence for \u201cOttoman decadence,\u201d which supposedly began at some time during the second half of the sixteenth century. But recently, more note has been taken of the fact that the Ottoman Empire was still a formidable military and political power throughout the seventeenth century, and that noticeable though limited economic recovery followed the crisis of the years around 1600; after the crisis of the 1683\u201399 war, there followed a longer and more decisive economic upswing. Major evidence of decline was not visible before the second half of the eighteenth century. Jump up ^ Peter B.

Directed by Brian Fee in his directorial debut, the screenplay was written by Kiel Murray, Bob Peterson and Mike Rich . The film is the sequel to Cars and Cars 2 and the third installment of the Cars film series. The returning voices of Owen Wilson , Bonnie Hunt and Larry the Cable Guy are joined by Cristela Alonzo , Chris Cooper , Armie Hammer , Nathan Fillion , Kerry Washington and Lea DeLaria , in addition to a dozen NASCAR personalities. [5] In the film, Lightning McQueen sets out to prove to a new generation of high tech race cars that he is still the best race car in the world. The film was released on June 16, 2017, grossed $384 million worldwide, [4] and received generally positive reviews, with many critics considering it an improvement over its predecessor, as well as praising its emotional story and animation.

As the season progresses, the amount of new racers begin to increase, resulting in many veterans either retiring, or being fired by their sponsors, to make way for the new generation. Then, in the last race of the season, McQueen is injured in a rollover crash while trying to catch up to Storm. Four months later, McQueen, recovering in Radiator Springs , isolates himself from his friends, and is watching footage of Doc Hudson , whose career ended in a similar accident, and McQueen fears that this might happen to him as well. After receiving some encouragement from his girlfriend, Sally , McQueen decides to continue racing and call his sponsors from Rust-eze, Rusty and Dusty, who surprise him by telling him they opened a new state-of-the-art training center known as the Rust-eze Racing Center, only to reveal that they have sold the team to a new owner, Sterling. There, McQueen meets Sterling, and is assigned to train under Cruz Ramirez . Cruz's methodical approach to training wears on McQueen's impatience, and he attempts to use a high tech racing simulator - only to end up damaging it. Sterling decides that McQueen is unfit to race, and instead, plans to use him for promotional materials only. McQueen contests this, and instead, makes a deal; if he should win the first race of the season, he will get to determine when he retires, otherwise he will retire on the spot. Sterling accepts the deal, but assigns him to work one-on-one with Cruz. McQueen tries to train on the nearby Fireball Beach in order to build up his speed, but he finds most of his time spent on teaching Cruz how to drive on various terrain. McQueen then attempts to race at a dirt track called Thunder Hollow, and inadvertently becomes part of a demolition derby called \u2033Crazy Eight\u2033 that Cruz wins, and her elation leads to McQueen's embarrassment. Distraught at the waste of training time, McQueen rages at Cruz, and in a fit of frustration, he accidentally breaks her trophy . Upset and in retaliation, Cruz furiously reveals that she had wanted to race professionally all her life, since she was inspired by McQueen, but never started a race because she felt intimidated by the other race cars, and simply lacked confidence. She resigns as McQueen's trainer, and heads back to the training center. Guilty and with no other options, McQueen calls up his friend Mater , who suggests that he should talk to Doc's mentor, Smokey in Doc's hometown of Thomasville. McQueen catches up to Cruz, and, after revealing that he had fixed her trophy, apologizes to her, and convinces her to join him. In Thomasville, McQueen meets up with Smokey, who recounts how, despite his forced retirement, Doc found a new happiness in training McQueen. After McQueen accepts that he will never be as fast as Storm, Smokey and his friends help McQueen learn new tricks to overcome his speed disadvantage with Cruz as his sparring partner . However, during the last practice race, Cruz suddenly overtakes him, giving him a flashback to his crash, shaking his confidence. At the race in Florida, McQueen is coached by Smokey from the pits, and manages to gradually push up through the ranks. Sterling, who still believes McQueen cannot win, orders Cruz back to the center, despite her wanting to stay and watch the race. McQueen overhears this, and remembers Cruz's speech about wanting to be a racer. He devises a plan; the next time he pits, he tells his crew to outfit Cruz in his racing number to try and finally beat Storm, against Sterling's wishes. Cruz is initially shaken by her lack of confidence, but Smokey and McQueen help her to pull ahead. On the last lap, Cruz catches up to Storm. Storm, feeling threatened, tries to intimidate her - even to the point of ramming her against the wall, but she uses one of Doc's tricks to repel off it, take the lead, and win. As Cruz celebrates her victory, Sterling offers her a role on his team, but she instead takes a counteroffer made by Tex Dinoco . Sterling reminds McQueen about his bet, but then McQueen's name is shared with Cruz's on the leaderboard as victors, since both he and Cruz raced with the winning number, thus winning the deal. Tex then goes to speak with Sterling, offering a deal. Sometime later, McQueen and Cruz return to Radiator Springs, decked out in Doc's old color and number, respectively. McQueen reveals that Tex has bought Rust-eze from Sterling, and McQueen decides to continue racing, and to be Cruz's crew chief. In the post-credits scene , Mater at his junkyard tries to answer an incoming call from his phone. Somehow he accidentally touches his reception antenna and his phone goes dead much to his dismay.

Production [ edit ] Development on Cars 3 began in 2011 after the release of Cars 2 , [13] and by March 2014 pre-production was underway. [14] In October 2014, Pixar's chief creative officer John Lasseter revealed at the Tokyo International Film Festival that the film would feature a tribute to Hayao Miyazaki 's film The Castle of Cagliostro , in a form of an old Citro\u00ebn 2CV . [15] Prior to the film's release, John Lasseter , director of the previous Cars films, stated that the film had a \"very emotional story\", similar in tone to the first film. [16] Co-writer Kiel Murray, who also co-wrote the original Cars , said of the return to the series roots, \"With these franchises you always want to know who it's about. The first movie was about McQueen, and the second movie was a sort of off-ramp to the Mater story. We wanted to get back to the McQueen story. When we looked at what would be next for him, we wondered what that would be like both as an athlete, and also for what he was dealing with in the rest of his life.\" [17] On January 5, 2017, it was announced that Armie Hammer and Cristela Alonzo would voice Jackson Storm and Cruz Ramirez, respectively. Two months later, Nathan Fillion, Kerry Washington and Lea Delaria joined the cast. [8] The production utilized a new rendering system, RIS, which made scenes like the demolition derby race possible. The system was previously used on Pixar's Finding Dory . [18] Soundtracks [ edit ] There are two soundtracks released for the third film. The original motion picture soundtrack features rock/pop songs featured in the film, while the original score soundtrack features the score composed and conducted by Randy Newman .

[22] The film had a special screening for the NASCAR industry in Kannapolis, North Carolina on May 23, 2017. [23] The world premiere was held in Anaheim, California on June 10, 2017. [24] Video game [ edit ] Main article: Cars 3: Driven to Win A tie-in video game has been announced to accompany the film's release. It was developed by Avalanche Software , which was shut down by Disney in 2016, but was acquired and revived by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment . It was released on Nintendo Switch , PlayStation 3 , PlayStation 4 , Wii U , Xbox 360 , and Xbox One on June 13, 2017, in North America, [25] in Europe and Australia on July 14, 2017, [26] and in Japan on July 20, 2017. [27] As Disney no longer develops and publishes video games after the release of Disney Infinity 3.0 , Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment published the tie-in game. [28] Home media [ edit ] Cars 3 was released on Digital HD on October 24, 2017 and was released on DVD , Blu-ray , and 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray on November 7, 2017, by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment . [29] Short Film [ edit ] BBC, Disney, and LEGO have released a short film via Youtube, on April 13, 2018, that is inspired by both the Cars animated series as well as the popular Top Gear TV series. The film tells the story of Lightning McQueen's trip to the Top Gear track where he achieves his dream of racing the Stig around the track. [30] Reception [ edit ] Box office [ edit ] Cars 3 grossed $153 million in the United States and Canada and $231 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $384 million, against a production budget of $175 million. [4] In North America, Cars 3 was released alongside Rough Night , 47 Meters Down and All Eyez on Me , and was projected to gross $55\u201360 million from 4,256 theaters in its opening weekend. [31] [32] It made $2.8 million from Thursday night previews and $19.5 million on its first day. It went on to open to $53.7 million, finishing first at the box office and dethroning two-time first-place finisher Wonder Woman . Cars 3 had the lowest opening of the series, but nevertheless was the 16th Pixar film to debut at number one. [33] In its second weekend, the film grossed $24.1 million, dropping to third place, behind Transformers: The Last Knight and Wonder Woman . [34] In its third weekend the film made $9.7 million ($14.1 million over the five-day 4th of July holiday weekend), dropping to 5th. [35] Internationally, the film made $21.3 million from its opening in 23 markets, which was 9% more than Cars 2 and 29% more than Cars . [36] The film opened in China on August 25 and grossed $10.8 million over its debut weekend. [37] The biggest markets in terms of total earnings are China ($20.8 million), followed by France ($19.5 million), Japan ($16.1 million), Mexico ($15.6 million), and the UK ($15.2 million). [38] Critical response [ edit ] On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes , the film has an approval rating of 67% based on 193 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \" Cars 3 has an unexpectedly poignant story to go with its dazzling animation, suggesting Pixar's most middle-of-the-road franchise may have a surprising amount of tread left.\" [39] On Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating, the film has a score of 59 out of 100, based on reviews from 41 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". [40] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale. [33] In his review for Variety , Owen Gleiberman wrote, \" Cars 3 is a friendly, rollicking movie made with warmth and dash, and to the extent that it taps our primal affection for this series, it more than gets the job done. Yet in many ways it\u2019s the tasteful version of a straight-to-DVD (or streaming) sequel.\" [41] David Fear of Rolling Stone gave the film a positive review, saying: \"There's an emotional resonance to this story about growing old, chasing glory days and the joy of passing the baton that leaves the other two films choking on its digitally rendered dust. The end goal this time out isn't just to sell a few more toys and Lightning McQueen lunchboxes. It's actually tapping into something deeper than a corporate bottom line.\" [42] Mike Ryan of Uproxx called the film 'The Rocky III Of The Cars Franchise,' and wrote \"There\u2019s a hint of sadness that seems to be present throughout Cars 3 that gives it a little more weight than the previous installments.\" [43] Alonso Duralde of TheWrap gave the film a mixed review, saying: \"As a spawner of merchandise, Cars 3 fires on all pistons but, as a movie, it's a harmless but never stimulating 109 minutes.\" [44] Vicky Roach gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, saying: \"Returning to the iconic, backroads nostalgia of the original film, Cars 3 puts the flashy, unpopular middle film squarely in its rear vision mirror. The route that the filmmakers take might be familiar, but after gunning it, they take the corners like pros.\" [45] Accolades [ edit ] Award Date of ceremony Category Recipient(s) and nominee(s) Result Ref.

But like any sequel, from Toy Story 4 to Incredibles 2 , as long as there's a good story to tell it's worth investing, we do love these characters, we love them as much as the public does.\" [58] Regarding which character would be the main protagonist in the film, Reher and Warren stated that \"if Cruz is a breakout character, kind of like Mater was, she would be involved in a 4 \". [59] Owen Wilson stated at a Cars 3 press event that possible stories have been discussed for a Cars 4 , though he would personally like for a fourth Cars film to delve into aspects of the thriller genre , akin to Cars 2 .

{"question": "each dot that makes up a satellite image is called a pixel. true or false", "answer": "", "context": "Pixel - Wikipedia Pixel From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search This article is about the picture element. For other uses, including for the plural form \"pixels\", see Pixel (disambiguation) . This example shows an image with a portion greatly enlarged, in which the individual pixels are rendered as small squares and can easily be seen. A photograph of sub-PIXEL display elements on a laptop's LCD screen In digital imaging , a pixel , pel , [1] dots , or picture element [2] is a physical point in a raster image , or the smallest addressable element in an all points addressable display device ; so it is the smallest controllable element of a picture represented on the screen. Each pixel is a sample of an original image; more samples typically provide more accurate representations of the original. The intensity of each pixel is variable. In color imaging systems, a color is typically represented by three or four component intensities such as red, green, and blue , or cyan, magenta, yellow, and black . In some contexts (such as descriptions of camera sensors ), pixel refers to a single scalar element of a multi-component representation (more precisely called a photosite in the camera sensor context, although the neologism sensel is sometimes used to describe the elements of a digital camera's sensor), [3] while in yet other contexts it may refer to the set of component intensities for a spatial position. Drawing a distinction between pixels, photosites, and samples may reduce confusion when describing color systems that use chroma subsampling or cameras that use Bayer filter to produce color components via upsampling. The word pixel is a portmanteau of pix (from \"pictures\", shortened to \"pics\") and el (for \"element\"); similar formations with ' el' include the words voxel [4] and texel . [4] Contents [ hide ] 1 Etymology 2 Technical 2.1 Sampling patterns 2.2 Resolution of computer monitors 2.3 Resolution of telescopes 2.4 Bits per pixel 2.5 Subpixels 3 Megapixel 4 See also 5 References 6 External links Etymology [ edit ] The word \"pixel\" was first published in 1965 by Frederic C. Billingsley of JPL , to describe the picture elements of video images from space probes to the Moon and Mars. [5] Billingsley had learned the word from Keith E. McFarland, at the Link Division of General Precision in Palo Alto , who in turn said he did not know where it originated. McFarland said simply it was \"in use at the time\" (circa 1963). [6] The word is a combination of pix , for picture, and element . The word pix appeared in Variety magazine headlines in 1932, as an abbreviation for the word pictures , in reference to movies. [7] By 1938, \"pix\" was being used in reference to still pictures by photojournalists. [6] The concept of a \"picture element\" dates to the earliest days of television, for example as \" Bildpunkt \" (the German word for pixel , literally 'picture point') in the 1888 German patent of Paul Nipkow . According to various etymologies, the earliest publication of the term picture element itself was in Wireless World magazine in 1927, [8] though it had been used earlier in various U.S. patents filed as early as 1911. [9] Some authors explain pixel as picture cell, as early as 1972. [10] In graphics and in image and video processing, pel is often used instead of pixel . [11] For example, IBM used it in their Technical Reference for the original PC . Pixels, abbreviated as 'px,' are also a unit of measurement commonly used in graphic and web design, equivalent to roughly 1 \u2044 96 inch (0.26\u00a0mm). This measurement is used to make sure a given element will display as the same size no matter what screen resolution views it. [12] Pixilation , spelled with a second i , is an unrelated filmmaking technique that dates to the beginnings of cinema, in which live actors are posed frame by frame and photographed to create stop-motion animation. An archaic British word meaning \"possession by spirits ( pixies )\", the term has been used to describe the animation process since the early 1950s; various animators, including Norman McLaren and Grant Munro , are credited with popularizing it. [13] Technical [ edit ] A pixel does not need to be rendered as a small square. This image shows alternative ways of reconstructing an image from a set of pixel values, using dots, lines, or smooth filtering. A pixel is generally thought of as the smallest single component of a digital image. However, the definition is highly context-sensitive. For example, there can be \" printed pixels \" in a page, or pixels carried by electronic signals, or represented by digital values, or pixels on a display device, or pixels in a digital camera (photosensor elements). This list is not exhaustive and, depending on context, synonyms include pel, sample, byte, bit, dot, and spot. Pixels can be used as a unit of measure such as: 2400 pixels per inch, 640 pixels per line, or spaced 10 pixels apart. The measures dots per inch (dpi) and pixels per inch (ppi) are sometimes used interchangeably, but have distinct meanings, especially for printer devices, where dpi is a measure of the printer's density of dot (e.g. ink droplet) placement. [14] For example, a high-quality photographic image may be printed with 600 ppi on a 1200 dpi inkjet printer. [15] Even higher dpi numbers, such as the 4800 dpi quoted by printer manufacturers since 2002, do not mean much in terms of achievable resolution . [16] The more pixels used to represent an image, the closer the result can resemble the original. The number of pixels in an image is sometimes called the resolution, though resolution has a more specific definition. Pixel counts can be expressed as a single number, as in a \"three-megapixel\" digital camera, which has a nominal three million pixels, or as a pair of numbers, as in a \"640 by 480 display\", which has 640 pixels from side to side and 480 from top to bottom (as in a VGA display), and therefore has a total number of 640\u00d7480 = 307,200 pixels or 0.3 megapixels. The pixels, or color samples, that form a digitized image (such as a JPEG file used on a web page) may or may not be in one-to-one correspondence with screen pixels, depending on how a computer displays an image. In computing, an image composed of pixels is known as a bitmapped image or a raster image . The word raster originates from television scanning patterns, and has been widely used to describe similar halftone printing and storage techniques. Sampling patterns [ edit ] For convenience, pixels are normally arranged in a regular two-dimensional grid . By using this arrangement, many common operations can be implemented by uniformly applying the same operation to each pixel independently. Other arrangements of pixels are possible, with some sampling patterns even changing the shape (or kernel ) of each pixel across the image. For this reason, care must be taken when acquiring an image on one device and displaying it on another, or when converting image data from one pixel format to another. For example: Text rendered using ClearType LCD screens typically use a staggered grid, where the red, green, and blue components are sampled at slightly different locations. Subpixel rendering is a technology which takes advantage of these differences to improve the rendering of text on LCD screens. The vast majority of color digital cameras use a Bayer filter , resulting in a regular grid of pixels where the color of each pixel depends on its position on the grid. A clipmap uses a hierarchical sampling pattern, where the size of the support of each pixel depends on its location within the hierarchy. Warped grids are used when the underlying geometry is non-planar, such as images of the earth from space. [17] The use of non-uniform grids is an active research area, attempting to bypass the traditional Nyquist limit . [18] Pixels on computer monitors are normally \"square\" (that is, have equal horizontal and vertical sampling pitch); pixels in other systems are often \"rectangular\" (that is, have unequal horizontal and vertical sampling pitch \u2013 oblong in shape), as are digital video formats with diverse aspect ratios , such as the anamorphic widescreen formats of the Rec. 601 digital video standard. Resolution of computer monitors [ edit ] Computers can use pixels to display an image, often an abstract image that represents a GUI . The resolution of this image is called the display resolution and is determined by the video card of the computer. LCD monitors also use pixels to display an image, and have a native resolution . Each pixel is made up of triads , with the number of these triads determining the native resolution. On some CRT monitors, the beam sweep rate may be fixed, resulting in a fixed native resolution. Most CRT monitors do not have a fixed beam sweep rate, meaning they do not have a native resolution at all - instead they have a set of resolutions that are equally well supported. To produce the sharpest images possible on an LCD, the user must ensure the display resolution of the computer matches the native resolution of the monitor. Resolution of telescopes [ edit ] The pixel scale used in astronomy is the angular distance between two objects on the sky that fall one pixel apart on the detector (CCD or infrared chip). The scale s measured in radians is the ratio of the pixel spacing p and focal length f of the preceding optics, s = p/f . (The focal length is the product of the focal ratio by the diameter of the associated lens or mirror.) Because p is usually expressed in units of arcseconds per pixel, because 1 radian equals 180/\u03c0*3600\u2248206,265 arcseconds, and because diameters are often given in millimeters and pixel sizes in micrometers which yields another factor of 1,000, the formula is often quoted as s=206p/f . Bits per pixel [ edit ] Main article: Color depth The number of distinct colors that can be represented by a pixel depends on the number of bits per pixel (bpp). A 1 bpp image uses 1-bit for each pixel, so each pixel can be either on or off. Each additional bit doubles the number of colors available, so a 2 bpp image can have 4 colors, and a 3 bpp image can have 8 colors: 1 bpp, 2 1 = 2 colors ( monochrome ) 2 bpp, 2 2 = 4 colors 3 bpp, 2 3 = 8 colors ... 8 bpp, 2 8 = 256 colors 16 bpp, 2 16 = 65,536 colors (\" Highcolor \" ) 24 bpp, 2 24 = 16,777,216 colors (\" Truecolor \") For color depths of 15 or more bits per pixel, the depth is normally the sum of the bits allocated to each of the red, green, and blue components. Highcolor , usually meaning 16 bpp, normally has five bits for red and blue each, and six bits for green, as the human eye is more sensitive to errors in green than in the other two primary colors. For applications involving transparency, the 16 bits may be divided into five bits each of red, green, and blue, with one bit left for transparency. A 24-bit depth allows 8 bits per component. On some systems, 32-bit depth is available: this means that each 24-bit pixel has an extra 8 bits to describe its opacity (for purposes of combining with another image). Subpixels [ edit ] Geometry of color elements of various CRT and LCD displays; phosphor dots in the color display of CRTs (top row) bear no relation to pixels or subpixels. Many display and image-acquisition systems are, for various reasons, not capable of displaying or sensing the different color channels at the same site. Therefore, the pixel grid is divided into single-color regions that contribute to the displayed or sensed color when viewed at a distance. In some displays, such as LCD, LED, and plasma displays, these single-color regions are separately addressable elements, which have come to be known as subpixels . [19] For example, LCDs typically divide each pixel vertically into three subpixels. When the square pixel is divided into three subpixels, each subpixel is necessarily rectangular. In display industry terminology, subpixels are often referred to as pixels , [ by whom? ] as they are the basic addressable elements in a viewpoint of hardware, and hence pixel circuits rather than subpixel circuits is used. Most digital camera image sensors use single-color sensor regions, for example using the Bayer filter pattern, and in the camera industry these are known as pixels just like in the display industry, not subpixels . For systems with subpixels, two different approaches can be taken: The subpixels can be ignored, with full-color pixels being treated as the smallest addressable imaging element; or The subpixels can be included in rendering calculations, which requires more analysis and processing time, but can produce apparently superior images in some cases. This latter approach, referred to as subpixel rendering , uses knowledge of pixel geometry to manipulate the three colored subpixels separately, producing an increase in the apparent resolution of color displays. While CRT displays use red-green-blue-masked phosphor areas, dictated by a mesh grid called the shadow mask, it would require a difficult calibration step to be aligned with the displayed pixel raster, and so CRTs do not currently use subpixel rendering. The concept of subpixels is related to samples . Megapixel [ edit ] Diagram of common sensor resolutions of digital cameras including megapixel values A megapixel (MP) is a million pixels; the term is used not only for the number of pixels in an image, but also to express the number of image sensor elements of digital cameras or the number of display elements of digital displays . For example, a camera that makes a 2048\u00d71536 pixel image (3,145,728 finished image pixels) typically uses a few extra rows and columns of sensor elements and is commonly said to have \"3.2 megapixels\" or \"3.4 megapixels\", depending on whether the number reported is the \"effective\" or the \"total\" pixel count. [20] Digital cameras use photosensitive electronics, either charge-coupled device (CCD) or complementary metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor (CMOS) image sensors, consisting of a large number of single sensor elements, each of which records a measured intensity level. In most digital cameras, the sensor array is covered with a patterned color filter mosaic having red, green, and blue regions in the Bayer filter arrangement, so that each sensor element can record the intensity of a single primary color of light. The camera interpolates the color information of neighboring sensor elements, through a process called demosaicing , to create the final image. These sensor elements are often called \"pixels\", even though they only record 1 channel (only red, or green, or blue) of the final color image. Thus, two of the three color channels for each sensor must be interpolated and a so-called N-megapixel camera that produces an N-megapixel image provides only one-third of the information that an image of the same size could get from a scanner. Thus, certain color contrasts may look fuzzier than others, depending on the allocation of the primary colors (green has twice as many elements as red or blue in the Bayer arrangement). DxO Labs invented the Perceptual MegaPixel (P-MPix) to measure the sharpness that a camera produces when paired to a particular lens \u2013 as opposed to the MP a manufacturer states for a camera product which is based only on the camera's sensor. The new P-MPix claims to be a more accurate and relevant value for photographers to consider when weighing-up camera sharpness. [21] As of mid-2013, the Sigma 35mm f/1.4 DG HSM lens mounted on a Nikon D800 has the highest measured P-MPix. However, with a value of 23 MP, it still wipes-off more than one-third of the D800's 36.3 MP sensor. [22] One new method to add Megapixels has been introduced in a Micro Four Thirds System camera which only uses 16MP sensor, but can produce 64MP RAW (40MP JPEG) by making two exposures, shifting the sensor by a half pixel between them. Using a tripod to take level multi-shots within an instance, the multiple 16MP images are then generated into a unified 64MP image.

It was the first Air Bud movie to be filmed without Buddy , the canine star of the first two films; Buddy died after production of the previous film, Golden Receiver . World Pup was the first film in the Air Bud series not to be released theatrically in the US; however, it was played in Philippine theaters for a limited time. Contents [ hide ] 1 Plot 2 Cast 3 Film location 4 External links Plot [ edit ] Teenager Josh Framm's mother, Jackie, has just married her veterinarian boyfriend, Patrick Sullivan. Josh and his best friend, Tom Stewart, have just made their school's soccer team when their coach reveals that their team will become co-ed. Josh meets Emma, an attractive girl who just moved with her family from England ; and not only will she be playing on his soccer team, but she also has a golden retriever named Molly. Buddy also finds Molly attractive. Emma invites Josh and Tom to a party at her house and Tom dressed up like a British soldier and he looked quite silly. At the same time, things work out between Buddy and Molly and they become infatuated on the second floor in Emma's house, all the while Andrea Framm and her best friend Tammy want to scope out what was going on at the party. Molly quickly has puppies with Josh's basketball and football-playing dog, Buddy. Next, it is discovered that Buddy also has the uncanny ability to play soccer. However, the soccer committee decided to ban the Timberwolves from the soccer league just because they had Buddy on their team. The Timberwolves could remove Buddy from their team or remove their team from the league. Knowing Buddy was the star player, they naturally quit the league. The head of the committee's son sees that the Timberwolves have been banned from the league and is outraged, making the head of the committee to have a change of heart, letting the Timberwolves back into the league. Buddy has a uniform and is on the roster, leading Josh's soccer team to the state championship. However, trouble occurs when Buddy's six newborn puppies are kidnapped by a man called Snerbert ( Martin Ferrero ) who wants to sell them for whippets . Once they have been caught, Snerbert's assistant, Webster, confessed and helped bring Josh, and Buddy to the championships, which their team was losing horribly on because the two were late. They didn't care about Snerbert because Buddy had an army of dogs and they weren't going to let Snerbert go anywhere. Buddy's team wins the championships.

In the 11th century, the city was renamed Kyoto (\"capital city\"), after the Chinese word for capital city, jingdu ( \u4eac\u90fd ). [5] After the city of Edo was renamed Tokyo ( \u6771\u4eac , meaning \"Eastern Capital\") in 1868, and the seat of the Emperor was transferred there, Kyoto was known for a short time as Saiky\u014d ( \u897f\u4eac , meaning \"Western Capital\"). Contemporary Kyoto is occasionally referred to as thousand-year capital ( \u5343\u5e74\u306e\u90fd ). Obsolete spellings for the city's name include Kioto , Miaco and Meaco . Another term commonly used to refer to the city in the pre-modern period was Keishi ( \u4eac\u5e2b ), meaning \"metropolis\" or \"capital\". [6] History [ edit ] 18th century European town map of \"Miaco\" See also: Timeline of Kyoto Origins [ edit ] Although archaeological evidence suggests human settlement in Kyoto began as early as the Paleolithic period, [7] relatively little is known about human activity in the area before the 6th century, around which time the Shimogamo Shrine is believed to have been established. Heian-ky\u014d [ edit ] Main article: Heian-ky\u014d During the 8th century, when powerful Buddhist clergy became involved in the affairs of the Imperial government, Emperor Kanmu chose to relocate the capital in order to distance it from the clerical establishment in Nara . His last choice for the site was the village of Uda, in the Kadono district of Yamashiro Province . [8] The new city, Heian-ky\u014d ( \u5e73\u5b89\u4eac , \"tranquility and peace capital\") , a scaled replica of the then Tang capital Chang'an , [9] became the seat of Japan's imperial court in 794, beginning the Heian period of Japanese history . Although military rulers established their governments either in Kyoto ( Muromachi shogunate ) or in other cities such as Kamakura ( Kamakura shogunate ) and Edo ( Tokugawa shogunate ), Kyoto remained Japan's capital until the transfer of the imperial court to Tokyo in 1869 at the time of the Imperial Restoration . The city suffered extensive destruction in the \u014cnin War of 1467\u20131477, and did not really recover until the mid-16th century. During the \u014cnin War , the shugo collapsed, and power was divided among the military families. [10] Battles between samurai factions spilled into the streets, and came to involve the court nobility ( kuge ) and religious factions as well. Nobles' mansions were transformed into fortresses, deep trenches dug throughout the city for defense and as firebreaks, and numerous buildings burned. The city has not seen such widespread destruction since. In the late 16th century, Toyotomi Hideyoshi reconstructed the city by building new streets to double the number of north-south streets in central Kyoto, creating rectangle blocks superseding ancient square blocks. Hideyoshi also built earthwork walls called odoi ( \u5fa1\u571f\u5c45 ) encircling the city. Teramachi Street in central Kyoto is a Buddhist temple quarter where Hideyoshi gathered temples in the city. Throughout the Edo period , the economy of the city flourished as one of three major cities in Japan, the others being Osaka and Edo. Modern Kyoto [ edit ] Skyline of Kyoto City Down town of Kyoto City The Hamaguri rebellion of 1864 burnt down 28,000 houses in the city which showed the rebels' dissatisfaction towards the Tokugawa Shogunate. [11] The subsequent move of the Emperor to Tokyo in 1869 weakened the economy. The modern city of Kyoto was formed on April 1, 1889. The construction of Lake Biwa Canal in 1890 was one measure taken to revive the city. The population of the city exceeded one million in 1932. [12] There was some consideration by the United States of targeting Kyoto with an atomic bomb at the end of World War II because, as an intellectual center of Japan, it had a population large enough to possibly persuade the emperor to surrender. [13] In the end, at the insistence of Henry L. Stimson , Secretary of War in the Roosevelt and Truman administrations, the city was removed from the list of targets and replaced by Nagasaki . The city was largely spared from conventional bombing as well, although small-scale air raids did result in casualties. As a result, the Imperial City (Emeritus) of Kyoto is one of the few Japanese cities that still have an abundance of prewar buildings, such as the traditional townhouses known as machiya . However, modernization is continually breaking down the traditional Kyoto in favor of newer architecture, such as the Ky\u014dto Station complex. Kyoto became a city designated by government ordinance on September 1, 1956. In 1997, Kyoto hosted the conference that resulted in the protocol on greenhouse gas emissions .

The Yamashiro Basin is surrounded on three sides by mountains known as Higashiyama, Kitayama and Nishiyama, with a height just above 1,000 metres (3,281\u00a0ft) above sea level . This interior positioning results in hot summers and cold winters. There are three rivers in the basin, the Ujigawa to the south, the Katsuragawa to the west, and the Kamogawa to the east. Kyoto City takes up 17.9% of the land in the prefecture with an area of 827.9 square kilometres (319.7\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). The original city was arranged in accordance with traditional Chinese feng shui following the model of the ancient Chinese capital of Chang'an . The Imperial Palace faced south, resulting in Uky\u014d (the right sector of the capital) being on the west while Saky\u014d (the left sector) is on the east. The streets in the modern-day wards of Nakagy\u014d , Shimogy\u014d , and Kamigy\u014d-ku still follow a grid pattern. Today, the main business district is located to the south of the old Imperial Palace , with the less-populated northern area retaining a far greener feel. Surrounding areas do not follow the same grid pattern as the center of the city, though streets throughout Kyoto share the distinction of having names. Kyoto sits atop a large natural water table that provides the city with ample freshwater wells. Due to large-scale urbanization, the amount of rain draining into the table is dwindling and wells across the area are drying at an increasing rate. Demographics [ edit ] Historically, Kyoto was the largest city in Japan, later surpassed by Osaka and Edo ( Tokyo ) towards the end of the 16th century. In the pre-war years, Kyoto traded places with Kobe and Nagoya ranking as the 4th and 5th largest city. In 1947, it went back to being 3rd. By 1960 it had fallen to 5th again, and by 1990 it had fallen to 7th, in 2015 it is now 9th. Climate [ edit ] Kyoto has a humid subtropical climate ( K\u00f6ppen Cfa ), featuring a marked seasonal variation in temperature and precipitation. Summers are hot and humid, but winters are relatively cold with occasional snowfall. Kyoto's rain season begins around the middle of June and lasts until the end of July, yielding to a hot and sunny latter half of the summer. Kyoto, along with most of the Pacific coast and central areas of Japan is prone to typhoons during September and October.

Like other cities in Japan, Kyoto has a single mayor and a city council. Culture [ edit ] A tsukemono shop on Nishiki Street Although ravaged by wars, fires, and earthquakes during its eleven centuries as the imperial capital, Kyoto was spared from much of the destruction of World War II. It was removed from the atomic bomb target list (which it had headed) by the personal intervention of Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson , as Stimson wanted to save this cultural center, which he knew from his honeymoon and later diplomatic visits. [15] [16] A monk by the Katsura River in Arashiyama Ponto-ch\u014d Street With its 2,000 religious places \u2013 1,600 Buddhist temples and 400 Shinto shrines , as well as palaces, gardens and architecture intact \u2013 it is one of the best preserved cities in Japan. Among the most famous temples in Japan are Kiyomizu-dera , a magnificent wooden temple supported by pillars off the slope of a mountain; Kinkaku-ji , the Temple of the Golden Pavilion; Ginkaku-ji , the Temple of the Silver Pavilion; and Ry\u014dan-ji , famous for its rock garden . The Heian Jing\u016b is a Shinto shrine, built in 1895, celebrating the Imperial family and commemorating the first and last emperors to reside in Kyoto. Three special sites have connections to the imperial family: the Kyoto Gyoen area including the Kyoto Imperial Palace and Sent\u014d Imperial Palace , homes of the Emperors of Japan for many centuries; Katsura Imperial Villa , one of the nation's finest architectural treasures; and Shugaku-in Imperial Villa , one of its best Japanese gardens . In addition, the temple of Sennyu-ji houses the tombs of the emperors from Shij\u014d to K\u014dmei . Other sites in Kyoto include Arashiyama , the Gion and Pontoch\u014d geisha quarters, the Philosopher's Walk , and the canals that line some of the older streets. The \" Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto \" are listed by the UNESCO as a World Heritage Site . These include the Kamo Shrines (Kami and Shimo), Ky\u014d-\u014d-Gokokuji (T\u014d-ji), Kiyomizu-dera, Daigo-ji , Ninna-ji , Saih\u014d-ji (Kokedera), Tenry\u016b-ji , Rokuon-ji (Kinkaku-ji), Jish\u014d-ji (Ginkaku-ji), Ry\u014dan-ji , Hongan-ji , K\u014dzan-ji and the Nij\u014d Castle , primarily built by the Tokugawa shoguns . Other sites outside the city are also on the list. Kyoto is renowned for its abundance of delicious Japanese foods and cuisine. The special circumstances of Kyoto as a city away from the sea and home to many Buddhist temples resulted in the development of a variety of vegetables peculiar to the Kyoto area ( \u4eac\u91ce\u83dc , ky\u014d-yasai ) . Japan's television and film industry has its center in Kyoto. Many jidaigeki , action films featuring samurai, were shot at Toei Uzumasa Eigamura . [17] A film set and theme park in one, Eigamura features replicas of traditional Japanese buildings, which are used for jidaigeki . Among the sets are a replica of the old Nihonbashi (the bridge at the entry to Edo ), a traditional courthouse, a Meiji Period police box and part of the former Yoshiwara red-light district. Actual film shooting takes place occasionally, and visitors are welcome to observe the action. The dialect spoken in Kyoto is known as Ky\u014d-kotoba or Ky\u014dto-ben , a constituent dialect of the Kansai dialect . When Kyoto was the capital of Japan, the Kyoto dialect was the de facto standard Japanese and influenced the development of Tokyo dialect , the modern standard Japanese. Famous Kyoto expressions are a polite copula dosu , an honorific verb ending -haru , a greeting phrase okoshi-yasu \"welcome\", etc. Economy [ edit ] Nintendo main headquarters Light blue represents the Kyoto metropolitan area defined by Ky\u014dto Toshiken Jichitai Network and blue represents Kyoto MEA.

Tourism also forms a large base of Kyoto's economy. The city's cultural heritages are constantly visited by school groups from across Japan, and many foreign tourists also stop in Kyoto. In 2014, the city government announced that a record number of tourists had visited Kyoto, [28] and it was chosen as the world's best city by U.S. travel magazine. [29] Traditional Japanese crafts are also major industry of Kyoto, most of which are run by artisans in small plants. Kyoto's kimono weavers are particularly renowned, and the city remains the premier center of kimono manufacturing. Such businesses, vibrant in past centuries, have declined in recent years as sales of traditional goods stagnate. Sake brewing is Kyoto's traditional industry. Gekkeikan and Takara Holdings are major sake brewers headquartered in Kyoto. Other notable businesses headquartered in Kyoto includes Aiful , Ishida , MK , [30] Nissen Holdings , Oh-sho , Sagawa Express , Volks and Wacoal . The concentration of population to the capital city area is 55%, which is highest among the prefectures. The economic difference between the coastal area and inland area including Kyoto basin is significant. Encompassing \u00a5 10.12 trillion, Kyoto MEA has the fourth-largest economy in the country in 2010. [31] Colleges and universities [ edit ] Kyoto University See also: Higher education in Japan Home to 40 institutions of higher education , Kyoto is one of the academic centers in Japan. [32] Kyoto University is considered to be one of the top national universities nationwide. According to the Times Higher Education top-ranking university, Kyoto University is ranked the second university in Japan after University of Tokyo , and 25th overall in the world as of 2010 [update] . [33] The Kyoto Institute of Technology is also among the most famous universities in Japan and is considered to be one of the best universities for architecture and design in the country. Popular private universities, such as Doshisha University and Ritsumeikan University are also located in the city. Kyoto also has a unique higher education network called the Consortium of Universities in Kyoto , which consists of three national, three public (prefectural and municipal), and 45 private universities, as well as the city and five other organizations. The combination does not offer a degree, but offers the courses as part of a degree at participating universities. [34] In addition to Japanese universities and colleges, selected American universities also operates in the city for education and research. Kyoto Consortium for Japanese Studies (KCJS) is a combination of 14 American universities that sponsors a two-semester academic program for undergraduates who wish to do advanced work in Japanese language and cultural studies. Stanford University also operates their study abroad center for Japanese studies in Kyoto. [35] Transportation [ edit ] Kyoto and Karasuma Street seen from Kyoto Tower See also: Transport in Keihanshin Airport [ edit ] Kansai Airport express Haruka at Kyoto Station See also: Kansai International Airport and Itami Airport Although Kyoto does not have its own airport, travelers can get to the city via Kansai International Airport and Osaka International Airport in Osaka Prefecture . The Haruka Express operated by JR West carries passengers from Kansai Airport to Kyoto Station in 73 minutes. [36] Osaka Airport Transport buses connect Itami Airport and Kyoto Station Hachijo Gate in 50 minutes and cost 1,310 yen (as of 2017) for a one-way trip. [37] Some buses go further, make stops at major hotels and terminals in the downtown area. Buses [ edit ] A typical Kyoto Municipal Bus Kyoto's municipal bus network is extensive. Private carriers also operate within the city. Many tourists join commuters on the public buses, or take tour buses. Kyoto's buses have announcements in English and electronic signs with stops written in the Latin alphabet. Most city buses have a fixed fare. A one-day bus pass and a combined unlimited train and bus pass are also available. These are especially useful for visiting many different points of interest within Kyoto. The bus information center just outside the central station handles tickets and passes. The municipal transport company publishes a very useful leaflet called \"Bus Navi.\" It contains a route map for the bus lines to most sights and fare information. This too is available at the information center in front of the main station. Buses operating on routes within the city, the region, and the nation stop at Kyoto Station . In addition to Kyoto Station, bus transfer is available at the intersections of Shij\u014d Kawaramachi and Sanj\u014d Keihan . The intersection of Karasuma Kita\u014dji to the north of downtown has a major bus terminal serving passengers who take the Karasuma Line running beneath Karasuma Street , Kyoto's main north\u2013south street. Cycling [ edit ] Cycling is a very important form of personal transportation in the city. The geography and scale of the city are such that the city may be easily navigated on a bicycle. There are five bicycle rental stations and 21 EcoStations in central Kyoto. Because of the large number of cyclists, permitted bicycle parking areas can be difficult to find. [38] Bicycles parked in non-permitted areas are impounded. Roads [ edit ] The city is connected with other parts of Japan by the Meishin Expressway , which has two interchanges in the city: Kyoto Higashi (Kyoto East) in Yamashina-ku and Kyoto Minami (Kyoto South) in Fushimi-ku. The Kyoto-Jukan Expressway connects the city to northern regions of Kyoto Prefecture. The Daini Keihan Road is a new bypass (completed in 2010) to Osaka. Although Kyoto has fewer toll-highways than other comparable Japanese cities, it is served with dual and even triple-carriageway national roads. As of 2018 [update] , only 10.1 kilometres (6.3 miles) of the Hanshin Expressway Kyoto Route is in operation. [39] There are nine national highways in the city of Kyoto: Route 1 , Route 8 , Route 9 , Route 24 , Route 162 , Route 171 , Route 367 , Route 477 and Route 478 . Rail [ edit ] Inside Kyoto Station See also: Keihan Electric Railway , Hankyu Railway , Kintetsu Railway , Keifuku Electric Railroad , and Eizan Electric Railway Just like other major cities in Japan, Kyoto is well served by rail transportation systems operated by several different companies and organizations. The city's main gateway terminal, Kyoto Station , which is one of the most popular stations in the country, connects The T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen bullet train Line (see below) with five JR West lines, a Kintetsu line and a municipal subway line. The Keihan , the Hankyu , and other rail networks also offer frequent services within the city and to other cities and suburbs in the Kinki region. Subway [ edit ] Main article: Kyoto Municipal Subway The Kyoto Municipal Transportation Bureau operates the Kyoto Municipal Subway consisting of two lines: the Karasuma Line and the T\u014dzai Line . Karasuma Line [ edit ] An express service bound for Kokusaikaikan Station of the Karasuma Line is running on Kintetsu Kyoto Line Main article: Karasuma Line The Karasuma Line is coloured green, and its stations are given numbers following the letter \"K\". The line has following stations, from north to south: Kokusaikaikan (terminal) and Matsugasaki in Saky\u014d-ku ; Kitayama and Kita\u014dji in Kita-ku ; Kuramaguchi and Imadegawa in Kamigy\u014d-ku ; Marutamachi and Karasuma Oike in Nakagy\u014d-ku ; Shij\u014d , Goj\u014d and Ky\u014dto in Shimogy\u014d-ku ; Kuj\u014d and J\u016bj\u014d in Minami-ku ; and Kuinabashi and Takeda (terminal) in Fushimi-ku . Between Kita\u014dji and J\u016bj\u014d , trains run beneath the north-south Karasuma Street ( \u70cf\u4e38\u901a , Karasuma-dori ) , hence the name. They link to the other subway line, the T\u014dzai Line , at Karasuma Oike . They also connect to the JR lines at Kyoto Station and the Hankyu Kyoto Line running cross-town beneath Shij\u014d Street at the intersection of Shij\u014d Karasuma , Kyoto's central business district . At Shij\u014d Karasuma, the subway station is named Shij\u014d , whereas Hankyu's station is called Karasuma . The Transportation Bureau and Kintetsu jointly operate through services, which continue to the Kintetsu Kyoto Line to Kintetsu Nara Station in Nara . The Karasuma Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line connect at Kyoto and Takeda . All the stations are located in the city proper. Tozai Line [ edit ] Platform screen doors at Higashiyama Station of the T\u014dzai Line Main article: T\u014dzai Line (Kyoto) The T\u014dzai Line is coloured vermilion, and its stations are given numbers following the letter \"T\". This line runs from the southeastern area of the city, then east to west (i.e. t\u014dzai in Japanese) through the Kyoto downtown area where trains run beneath the three east-west streets: Sanj\u014d Street ( \u4e09\u6761\u901a , Sanj\u014d-dori ) , Oike Street ( \u5fa1\u6c60\u901a , Oike-dori ) and Oshik\u014dji Street ( \u62bc\u5c0f\u8def\u901a , Oshik\u014dji-dori ) . The line has following stations, from east to west: Rokujiz\u014d (terminal) in Uji ; Ishida and Daigo in Fushimi-ku ; Ono , Nagitsuji , Higashino , Yamashina and Misasagi in Yamashina-ku ; Keage , Higashiyama and Sanj\u014d Keihan in Higashiyama-ku ; Kyoto Shiyakusho-mae , Karasuma Oike , Nij\u014dj\u014d-mae , Nij\u014d and Nishi\u014dji Oike in Nakagy\u014d-ku ; and Uzumasa Tenjingawa (terminal) in Uky\u014d-ku . The Keihan Keishin Line has been integrated into this line, and thus Keihan provides through services from Hama\u014dtsu in the neighbouring city of \u014ctsu , the capital of Shiga Prefecture . The T\u014dzai Line connects to the Keihan lines at Rokujiz\u014d , Yamashina , Misasagi and Sanj\u014d Keihan , to the JR lines at Nij\u014d , Yamashina and Rokujiz\u014d , and to the Keifuku Electric Railroad at Uzumasa Tenjingawa. All the stations except Rokujiz\u014d are located in Kyoto. High-speed rail [ edit ] Shinkansen at Kyoto Station Main articles: T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen and Sany\u014d Shinkansen See also: Central Japan Railway Company and West Japan Railway Company The T\u014dkaid\u014d Shinkansen operated by JR Central provides high-speed rail service linking Kyoto with Nagoya , Yokohama and Tokyo to the east of Kyoto and with nearby Osaka and points west on the San'y\u014d Shinkansen , such as Kobe , Okayama , Hiroshima , Kitakyushu , and Fukuoka . The trip from Tokyo takes about two hours and eighteen minutes. From Hakata in Fukuoka, Nozomi takes you to Kyoto in just over three hours. All trains including Nozomi stop at Kyoto Station, serving as a gateway to not only Kyoto Prefecture but also northeast Osaka , south Shiga and north Nara . Waterways [ edit ] There are a number of rivers, canals and other navigable waterways in Kyoto. The Seta and Uji rivers ( Yodo River ), Kamogawa and Katsura river flow through Kyoto.

[41] The first is the Aoi Matsuri on May 15. Two months later (July 1 to 31) is the Gion Matsuri known as one of the 3 great festivals of Japan, culminating in a massive parade on July 17. Kyoto marks the Bon Festival with the Gozan no Okuribi , lighting fires on mountains to guide the spirits home (August 16). The October 22 Jidai Matsuri , Festival of the Ages, celebrates Kyoto's illustrious past. Gion Matsuri Aoi Matsuri Jidai Matsuri Gozan Okuribi Sports [ edit ] Football [ edit ] In football, Kyoto is represented by Kyoto Sanga F.C. who won the Emperor's Cup in 2002, and rose to J. League 's Division 1 in 2005. Kyoto Sanga has a long history as an amateur non-company club, although it was only with the advent of professionalization that it was able to compete in the Japanese top division. Nishikyogoku Athletic Stadium is its home stadium. Amateur football clubs such as F.C. Kyoto BAMB 1993 and Kyoto Shiko Club (both breakaway factions of the original Kyoto Shiko club that became Kyoto Sanga) as well as unrelated AS Laranja Kyoto and Amitie SC Kyoto compete in the regional Kansai soccer league. Baseball [ edit ] Between 1951 and 1952 the Central League team Shochiku Robins played their franchised games at Kinugasa Ballpark ( ja:\u8863\u7b20\u7403\u5834 , Kinugasa Kyujo ) in Kita-ku. In 2010, Nishikyogoku Stadium in Ukyo-ku became the home of a newly formed girls professional baseball team, the Kyoto Asto Dreams. Additionally, Kyoto's high school baseball teams are strong, with Heian and Toba in particular making strong showings recently at the annual tournament held in Koshien Stadium , Nishinomiya , near Osaka. Horse racing [ edit ] Kyoto Racecourse in Fushimi-ku is one of ten racecourses operated by the Japan Racing Association . It hosts notable horse races including the Kikuka-sh\u014d , Spring Tenno Sho , and Queen Elizabeth II Commemorative Cup . Tennis [ edit ] Kimiko Date , a tennis player who reached number 4 in WTA Rankings in the 1990s, was born here. International relations [ edit ] See also: List of twin towns and sister cities in Japan Kyoto, having been the capital city of Japan, a seat of learning and culture, has long-established ties with other great cities around the world. Many foreign scholars, artists and writers have stayed in Kyoto over the centuries.

{"question": "how old was sasuke when his clan died", "answer": "called", "context": "Sasuke Uchiha - Wikipedia Sasuke Uchiha From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search Sasuke Uchiha Naruto character Sasuke Uchiha as seen in Part I (right), Part II (left), and the finale as well as the Boruto film and series (middle) First appearance Naruto chapter 3: Enter Sasuke! (1999) Created by Masashi Kishimoto Voiced by Japanese Noriaki Sugiyama English Yuri Lowenthal Notable relatives Itachi Uchiha (brother, deceased) Sakura Uchiha (wife) Sarada Uchiha (daughter) Ninja rank Genin in Part I Rogue ninja in Part II Ninja team Team 7 ( Part I ) Taka ( Part II ) Sasuke Uchiha ( Japanese : \u3046\u3061\u306f \u30b5\u30b9\u30b1 , Hepburn : Uchiha Sasuke ) is a fictional character in the Naruto manga and anime franchise created by Masashi Kishimoto . Sasuke belongs to the Uchiha clan, a notorious and powerful ninja family allied with the village of Konohagakure . Most of its members were massacred by Sasuke's older brother, Itachi Uchiha , before the series begins, leaving Sasuke one of the few living members. At first, Sasuke is distant and seeks revenge for his clan by killing his brother, but he later becomes empathetic toward his teammates Naruto Uzumaki and Sakura Haruno . His feelings of powerlessness force him to abandon his village and quest to become stronger, regardless of the cost. Sasuke appears in several of the series' animated feature films and related media, including video games , original video animations ( OVAs ), and Boruto: Naruto the Movie (2015) and its manga sequel Boruto: Naruto Next Generations (2016), in which he is depicted as a vigilante supporting his village. Kishimoto conceived Sasuke as a rival of the series' title character Naruto Uzumaki. Despite Sasuke's dark character development later in the story, Kishimoto avoided portraying him as a villain; he found designing the character challenging and had difficulty creating a suitable look for him. Nonetheless, Kishimoto has grown to enjoy drawing him. In the manga's animated adaptations, Sasuke was voiced by Noriaki Sugiyama in Japanese and Yuri Lowenthal in English. Sasuke's character has received mixed responses from anime and manga publications. His impressive fighting skills, plot contribution, and rivalry with the title character received some praise, but he was criticized as a stereotypical rival in the mold of similar characters from other sh\u014dnen manga and as exhibiting a cold personality. Sasuke has placed highly in Naruto reader popularity polls. Character-based merchandise, including action figures and key chains , has been released. Contents [ hide ] 1 Creation 1.1 Development 1.2 Design 1.3 Personality and voice actors 2 Character 3 Appearances 3.1 In Naruto 3.1.1 In Part I 3.1.2 In Part II 3.2 In the Boruto franchise 3.3 In other media 4 Reception 4.1 Popularity 4.2 Merchandise 4.3 Critical response 5 References 6 External links Creation [ edit ] Development [ edit ] Manga artist Masashi Kishimoto did not include Sasuke Uchiha in his original concept for the Naruto series, a story revolving around the character Naruto Uzumaki . Discussing the series' future, his editor advised him to add a rival character for the protagonist Naruto and he created Sasuke. [1] The character's first name came from Sanpei Shirato 's manga Sasuke and Sarutobi Sasuke , a fictional ninja character in Japanese children's stories. [2] To introduce Sasuke, Kishimoto wrote a chapter that was set before the formation of his ninja squad, Team 7 . The idea was scrapped and Sasuke was introduced with Team 7, retaining the same traits and rivalry with Naruto. [3] Kishimoto had read a variety of manga to obtain ideas for the creation of an effective rivalry between two characters, which he incorporated into Naruto and Sasuke's relationship; he was also inspired by his relationship with his twin brother, Seishi Kishimoto . Since childhood, Masashi had worried about Seishi when he faced failure and had tried to help him. [4] To contrast Sasuke with Naruto, Kishimoto made him less emotional and depicted him as a \"cool genius\". He felt he had created an ideal rivalry in the pair, [5] and when one character progressed he ensured the other did as well. [6] Kishimoto wanted Naruto and Sasuke to seem like brothers and rivals, building on a mutual experience of childhood loneliness. Although Sasuke does not regard Naruto as a worthy opponent at first, he is surprised by Naruto's growth and becomes fiercely competitive. In the Part I finale, their rivalry leads to a fight and they grow further apart. Kishimoto said he did not want Sasuke to recognize Naruto as an equal until later in Part II . [7] When plot developments made Sasuke one of the story's antagonists, Kishimoto called him and Naruto yin and yang because of their differences and complementary natures. [6] During this period, he was asked whether Sasuke was good or evil; he replied that Sasuke was neither and called him a \"very pure person\". [8] He said although some of Sasuke's actions such as following his clan's ideals were positive, his self-centeredness tended to cause problems with others. Since the beginning of the story's serialization, Kishimoto planned to conclude the series with a fight between Sasuke and Naruto, but he was uncertain whether the characters would end up as friends or enemies. [9] Although both characters had used ninja techniques throughout the series, Kishimoto wanted the two fighters to rely on hand-to-hand combat for the climax of their final battle. [10] He decided to have Naruto forgive Sasuke because he had also forgiven Nagato , another former enemy. [11] Kishimoto found Sasuke a difficult character to write, requiring considerable planning. In the series finale, Sasuke leaves on a solo journey; Kishimoto later stated that in addition to atonement, Sasuke wants to discover the origin of the final antagonist, but this was not explained in the story. [4] He planned Sasuke and Sakura Haruno 's romance early in Naruto 's production and decided that despite having a good relationship with his allies, Sasuke would remain a rogue ninja at the end of the series. [12] Kishimoto wished to further explore Sasuke's role in the series after Natuto 's finale. He wanted to explain the connection between Sasuke and Sakura in the spin-off manga Naruto: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring , which focuses on their daughter, Sarada Uchiha . Despite their separation during Sasuke's mission, which draws him away from his village, the story explains the bond between the three characters. Kishimoto focused on the final scene of the Uchiha family, which he regards as the spin-off's most important facet. [13] Because Sasuke had few appearances in the Naruto films , Kishimoto decided to give him a bigger role in Boruto: Naruto the Movie , in which he teaches Naruto's firstborn child, Boruto Uzumaki ; a reference to Piccolo and Gohan in Akira Toriyama 's Dragon Ball manga series and also depicted in the manga Boruto: Naruto Next Generations . Kishimoto identified Naruto's fights alongside Sasuke against Momoshiki as the highlights of the film and asked that the film's staff pay close attention to those sequences. Two other scenes written by the staff which surprised Kishimoto were Sasuke's use of one of his taijutsu moves and the combination of his Susanoo technique and Naruto's recreation of the Nine-Tailed Fox . [14] [15] Design [ edit ] While early designs of Sasuke as seen in Part I (left) were similar to the final one, [16] for Part II (right) Kishimoto conceived multiple sketches which were scrapped. [17] Kishimoto regarded Sasuke as his most memorable character design because he was developed as Naruto's opposite. [18] He said the design of Sasuke and his Sharingan ability were influenced by the character Hiei in Yoshihiro Togashi 's manga series, YuYu Hakusho . [19] Sasuke originally had necklaces and ties around his arms and legs because Kishimoto had a habit of giving characters as much ornamentation as possible; realizing he could not draw such a complex character on a weekly basis, Kishimoto simplified the design to a basic contrast with Naruto's costume. [16] The Chidori \u2014 one of Sasuke and Kakashi Hatake 's best-known fighting techniques \u2014 originally had a different name that Kishimoto forgot. He found the name \"Chidori\" and its variant, the \"Lightning Blade\", appropriate. [7] Kishimoto considered Sasuke his most challenging character to design and draw. He lacked a clear idea of how his face should look, saying Sasuke seemed older than Naruto, his contemporary, [20] and felt this inconvenience was a result of his inexperience in drawing characters who were mature beyond their years. [16] Sasuke's hair, which was originally short to save Kishimoto time, slowly grew longer as the series progressed. [20] Mid-way through Part I, he drew a new costume for Sasuke with belts strapped around his arms and legs, but he returned to the character's original design because it took less time to draw. [21] Sasuke is his favorite character to draw despite the time and energy required, [16] and he compared Sasuke with Sakura in difficulty. [10] Kishimoto's superiors sometimes asked him to redraw parts of the manga that did not illustrate Sasuke well. [10] Kishimoto's design focus for Part II was Sasuke's older appearance. Originally, Kishimoto had wanted to draw him as a more attractive person, but the idea was discarded. An outfit he initially planned combined the younger Sasuke's outfit with new, more modern clothes. Kishimoto tried several other looks, including the use of Shimenawa to evoke the antagonist Orochimaru , and a turtleneck and military uniform to connote cleanliness. He avoided the second option due to similarities with cold weather clothing and eventually chose Japanese clothing and a chokut\u014d sword. [17] For The Last: Naruto the Movie , Kishimoto gave Sasuke a new, young-adult design with sharper facial features. [22] In contrast with the older Naruto, who cut his hair, Sasuke's hairstyle grew longer to cover part of the character's face. In the original concept, the hair hid Sasuke's mysterious left eye \u2014 the Rinnegan . According to Kishimoto, he decided to give the character a large hood because Sasuke concealed his identity during the events of the movie. Sasuke's design was specifically created to support his actions; the area that showed Sasuke had lost his left arm in the Naruto finale was also covered by his clothes. [23] Personality and voice actors [ edit ] Yuri Lowenthal , voice of Sasuke in the anime's English-language version Sasuke is voiced by Noriaki Sugiyama in Japanese media. At the beginning of the anime's first part , Sugiyama found difficulty voicing Sasuke because he knew little about his personality; he began to understand the character at the point in the story where Sasuke encounters his brother, Itachi Uchiha . Sugiyama read the manga and became particularly interested in Sasuke's development when the character left Konohagakure ; he wanted to re-voice some scenes from the anime , including Sasuke's departure from Konohagakure. [24] In Behind the Scenes of Uchiha , a feature about Sasuke and Itachi's backstory, Sugiyama said he had become emotional during the recording sessions of the sixth season of the anime's second part ( Naruto: Shippuden ), in which Sasuke learns the truth about his brother's role in the massacre of the Uchiha clan. [25] Sugiyama thought Sasuke's line, \"you are annoying\", summed up the character's feelings toward Sakura and indicated a change in their relationship each time it was said. Although she initially annoys him, he smiles when he repeats it before leaving Konohagakure. Naruto's Japanese voice actress, Junko Takeuchi , said Sasuke's line addressed to Sakura, \"see you next time... thank you\", revealed his feelings for her. Sugiyama stated that by the end of the series, Sasuke realized how much he had hurt Sakura's feelings and apologized to her after his final fight against Naruto because of this. While recording for Boruto: Naruto the Movie , Sugiyama expected to see a bond between Sasuke and his apprentice, Boruto Uzumaki. [26] According to Sugiyama, Sasuke's personality had changed for the Boruto anime series and the actor wanted fans to see the character's interaction with his family. [27] Yuri Lowenthal , who voices Sasuke in the English dubs , said he was honored to receive the role since many actors had auditioned for it, and he added that the job was stressful. Although fans were critical of deviations and mistakes in his recordings, [28] he enjoyed voicing the character. [29] His first impression of Sasuke was of \"a serious guy dedicated to his training\", but his view changed as he learned about the character's backstory. [30] Lowenthal said in 2010 that Sasuke was one of the first dark characters he voiced, adding, \"he's sort of a hero, but he's not the na\u00efve, young white\u2013hat hero \". [31] Lowenthal said some of Sasuke's lines, such as his use of the word \"kill\", were changed because Viz Media often censored parts of the series' dialogue for Western viewers. As a result, he found the original Japanese version truer to the character. [32] Character [ edit ] A replica of Sasuke's Kusanagi sword Sasuke is introduced in Part I as a young, spiky-black-haired teenager wearing a blue shirt with an image of a fan that represents his clan on its back. He also wears short white pants and a Konohagakure headband. [33] Early in the series, Orochimaru brands Sasuke with a Cursed Seal that, when activated, covers his body with black marks and later gives him gray skin, white hair, and claw-like wings. [34] In Part II, he is normally depicted wearing a white kimono and black pants. Although he is skilled in the use of shuriken , in Part II Sasuke uses a chokut\u014d sword that he calls Kusanagi . In addition to using Kusanagi for swordsmanship , Sasuke combines it with lightning-based techniques to increase the power of his attacks. [35] [36] In The Last: Naruto the Movie , his adult wardrobe consists of gray pants and a light-brown cloak over a black shirt, [22] while in Boruto: Naruto the Movie , he wears black pants and a black cape over a lilac vest. [12] Sasuke is a silent character who tries to gain more power and kill his older brother, Itachi, for betraying and murdering their clan. [37] He cares about his teammates and saves them on numerous occasions, [38] [39] [40] but he severs all of his bonds later in Part I, believing this will strengthen him. Sasuke is moved when Naruto Uzumaki wants him to make peace with the village; he considers Naruto his only friend. [41] Sasuke becomes more kindhearted by the end of the series, but he decides not to return home, chooses to redeem himself, and searches for an enemy threatening the peace of Konohagakure. [42] Appearances [ edit ] In Naruto [ edit ] In Part I [ edit ] Sasuke is introduced in the third chapter of Naruto ' s manga as a young ninja assigned to become a member of Team\u00a07 alongside Naruto Uzumaki and Sakura Haruno. [43] The trio are trained under the guidance of Kakashi Hatake. [44] Although Sasuke is antisocial, he starts caring about Naruto and Sakura. [45] During a mission, Sasuke awakens his Sharingan \u2014 his clan's inherited ability to see through illusions \u2014 which allows him to learn imperceptible movements at a superhuman rate. [46] [47] It is revealed later that Sasuke is the sole survivor of the once-powerful Uchiha clan of Konohagakure. He, at the age of seven, survived the massacre of his clan perpetrated by his brother, Itachi, who spared Sasuke's life because he did not consider him worth killing. [48] Sasuke seeks strong fighting opponents to reassure himself his power is growing. [49] During a ninja examination meant to improve their ranks, Team\u00a07 encounters Orochimaru, an exile from Konohagakure who afflicts Sasuke with a Cursed Seal that contains a fragment of Orochimaru's consciousness, which increases Sasuke's physical abilities, but makes him cruel and sadistic. [50] [51] Kakashi teaches Sasuke the lightning-based offensive technique called Chidori in an attempt to appease Sasuke's desire for power. [52] During a siege of Konohagakure, a beserker ninja named Gaara beats Sasuke, who is rescued by Naruto. Shortly afterward, Itachi returns to the village; Sasuke tries to kill him, but he is beaten and tortured instead. He decides to leave Team\u00a07 and Konohagakure to become stronger. [53] Thinking Orochimaru's training will make him more powerful, Sasuke becomes an outlaw. [54] Naruto follows him and they fight when Sasuke refuses to return; Sasuke wins, spares Naruto's life, and continues to Orochimaru's hideout. [55] In Part II [ edit ] After two-and-a-half years of training, Sasuke absorbs Orochimaru before he can possess his younger body. [56] Following this, Sasuke forms Team Hebi to find Itachi. [57] Itachi and Sasuke fight and Itachi dies at the climax of the battle from an illness. [58] Sasuke then meets Tobi , Itachi's superior, who reveals that Itachi killed the Uchiha clan under orders from Konohagakure and spared Sasuke out of love rather than contempt. [58] Sasuke rejoins Hebi \u2014 which he renames Taka \u2014 and declares his intention to destroy his former village in retribution. Due to his brother's death, Sasuke's Sharingan has evolved into a Mangekyo Sharingan , giving him powerful new techniques. [59] After he agrees to work temporarily for Tobi's terrorist organization, Akatsuki , Sasuke becomes a criminal. [60] He kills Danzo Shimura \u2014 a mastermind of the Uchiha massacre and the Hokage , the leader of Konohagakure. [61] Sasuke is confronted by his former Team\u00a07 colleagues and Naruto challenges him to a death match. [62] Sasuke initially prepares to fight Naruto but instead decides to protect Konohagakure after he encounters the re-animated bodies of Itachi [63] and the First Hokage . [64] [65] He rejoins Team\u00a07 and fights the Ten-Tails monster that is controlled by the masterminds behind Akatsuki. [66] [67] Sasuke inherits the Rinnegan \u2014 a legendary eye technique \u2014 from the spirit of the Sage of the Six Paths Hagoromo Otsutsuki, the first ninja. Team\u00a07 fights and seals an ancient being called Kaguya Otsutsuki \u2014 Hagoromo's mother \u2014 who created the Ten-Tails. [68] Sasuke then fights Naruto alone to settle their village's future; [69] when he loses his left arm, Sasuke surrenders and reconciles with Naruto. [70] Sasuke then destroys Akatsuki's illusion placed on mankind with his Rinnegan. He is pardoned for his crimes by Kakashi \u2014 the current Hokage \u2014 and decides to travel the world in search of redemption. Before leaving, he says farewell to both Sakura and Naruto with gratitude. [42] By the end of the manga, Sasuke has returned to the village and married Sakura; together they have a daughter, Sarada. [71] In the Boruto franchise [ edit ] In the 2015 spin-off manga Naruto: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring , Sasuke has discovered that a new threat is approaching and is traveling across the world to find clues about it. He rejoins Naruto to oppose Orochimaru's former test subjects, who want to revive the Akatsuki and avenge Itachi. After defeating the test subjects, Sasuke bonds with his daughter for the first time and resumes his mission. [72] This spin-off manga was adapted into the anime Boruto: Naruto Next Generations (episodes 19-23), in which Sasuke briefly returns to his village before the arc begins and asks Naruto to offer Sakura his apologies. [27] An upcoming novel by Mirei Miyamoto will focus on Sasuke's life as a father. [73] In Boruto: Naruto the Movie (2015), Sasuke comes back to Konohagakure to warn Naruto of the threat posed by Momoshiki Otsutsuki and Kinshiki Otsutsuki , Kaguya's descendants. [74] He meets Naruto's son, Boruto, who asks Sasuke to train him as an apprentice so he can surpass his father. Sasuke agrees once Boruto learns the technique Rasengan, a move often used by Naruto. When Momoshiki and Kinshiki attack the village and kidnap Naruto, Sasuke joins his student and the four other Kage \u2014 the other villages' leaders \u2014 to save him. Following Naruto's rescue, he and Sasuke help Boruto to defeat Momoshiki, who has absorbed Kinshiki to increase his power. [74] Sasuke is also Boruto's teacher in the sequel manga, Boruto: Naruto Next Generations . [75] After Momoshiki's defeat, Sasuke notices the enemy has placed a seal on Boruto and tells the teenager to seek his help if necessary. [76] In other media [ edit ] Sasuke appears in the first four original video animations ( OVAs ) produced for the series. In the first episode, he helps Naruto and Konohamaru Sarutobi find a four-leaf clover ; [77] in the second, he joins Naruto's team for a mission; [77] he participates in a tournament in the third; and he works with Team 7 in the fourth. [78] [79] One OVA presents an alternate fight between Sasuke and Naruto in Naruto: Shippuden . [80] The character is present in the first two Naruto feature films; he guards a princess in Naruto the Movie: Ninja Clash in the Land of Snow (2004) and makes a brief appearance in a flashback in Naruto the Movie: Legend of the Stone of Gelel (2005). [81] The first Part II movie in which he appears is Naruto Shippuden 2: Bonds (2008). [82] The sixth Part II movie, Road to Ninja: Naruto the Movie (2012), contains a flirtatious, alternate-reality version of Sasuke. [83] In The Last: Naruto the Movie (2014), an adult Sasuke returns briefly to Konohagakure to protect it from a meteor. [84] He is a recurring character in the Naruto light novels and the protagonist of the 2012 manga Naruto Jinraiden: The Day the Wolf Howled , which explores Sasuke's reflections after Itachi's death and his decision to destroy Konohagakure. [85] In Sakura Hiden (2015), an adult Sasuke continues his journey of redemption but returns to Konohagakure out of concern for Sakura's safety. [86] In Akatsuki Hiden (2015), Sasuke meets two children who tell him stories about Akatsuki and they discuss Itachi's legacy. [87] He is the protagonist of Sasuke Shinden (2015); he agrees to aid Konohagakure by investigating a series of disappearances, which he solves with the help of Taka and a ninja named Sai . [88] Sasuke is also the protagonist of manga artist Kenji Taira's 2014 Naruto spin-off, Sasuke Uchiha's Sharingan Legend , in which he and Taka search for Itachi. According to Taira, Sasuke would be characterized as an \"idiot\". [89] Sasuke is a playable character in Naruto video games , including the Clash of Ninja and Ultimate Ninja series. [90] [91] [92] His Cursed Seal can be unlocked and activated in some games. Due to his absence from early Naruto: Shippuden episodes, Sasuke has not appeared in any games based on Naruto: Shippuden until the launch of Gekitou Ninja Taisen EX 2 . [93] Sasuke is also present in crossover games, such as Jump Super Stars , Jump Ultimate Stars , Battle Stadium D.O.N , and J-Stars Victory Vs . [94] [95] [96] [97] Reception [ edit ] Popularity [ edit ] Sasuke has ranked among the top-five Naruto characters in every Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump popularity poll of the series. Initially alternating between third and fourth places, he has finished first twice. [98] [99] A popularity poll on the Japanese website Charapedia ranked Sasuke and Naruto's rivalry as the best in anime. [100] At New York's 2015 Comic-Con , moderator Christopher Butcher and editor Jo Otsuki commented that Sasuke had become the series' most popular character, and Otsuki called him his favorite. Butcher wondered whether readers considered Sasuke a more-relatable character after he had embraced Naruto's positive outlook on life in the series finale. According to Otsuki, fans regarded Sasuke's character and abilities as \"cooler\" than those of his rival. [101] Jacob Hope of Anime News Network ( ANN ) listed Sasuke and Naruto as two of the \"Fiercest Frenemies\" in anime due to their resemblance despite being adversaries and their need to engage in a mortal fight to become friends. [102] Merchandise [ edit ] Sasuke merchandise includes key chains [103] and figurines . [104] [105] Boruto film audiences were offered fans bearing images of Sasuke and his daughter, Sarada. [106] To promote the video game Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 , two 1/6-scale statues depicting Sasuke and Naruto during their final clash from the series were developed by Luxembourgian company Tsume. [107] Japanese toy company Bandai released an action figure of Sasuke performing the Chidori move. [108] In May 2017, Bandai launched a figurine of Sasuke performing his Susanoo eye technique, which represents the god of thunder Raijin . Studio Pierrot released artwork that was sold alongside this figure. [109] Bandai also produced a limited-edition adult figurine of Sasuke as he appears in the Naruto finale and the Boruto franchise, which impressed Scott Green, a writer for Ain't It Cool News and Crunchyroll . [110] [111] Critical response [ edit ] The Eastern fan ( uchiwa ) is Sasuke's clan symbol. [112] Sasuke's character has received both praise and criticism in online and printed publications. [113] Reviewing the series' first part, writers said they enjoyed Sasuke's fights but disapproved of his dark personality, which resembled the stereotypical rival in sh\u014dnen manga . [114] [115] [116] Critics commended the relationship between Sasuke, Naruto, and Sakura; they regarded the characters as complex and mature because of their teamwork and despite their youth. [117] [118] Reviewers considered that the characters' tactics and the emphasis on their rivalry's emotional undercurrents made Sasuke and Naruto's final fight in the first part of the story one most entertaining of the series; [119] [120] and they praised the one-sided romantic relationship between Sasuke and Sakura. [121] [122] Although critics enjoyed Yuri Lowenthal's voicing of Sasuke, [123] Theron Martin of ANN said the actor had difficulty sounding younger in flashbacks. [124] Reviewers were more enthusiastic about Sasuke's character in the second part of the series. Critics stated that his more-emotional demeanor and his conversation with the Nine-Tailed Fox \u2014 a creature sealed within Naruto's body \u2014 made his scenes in Naruto: Shippuden interesting. [125] [126] Jason Thompson wrote that Sasuke had not become evil despite siding with the antagonist Orochimaru, lending ambiguity to his character. [127] Writers believed Sasuke's fights during the story's second part had a major impact on the plot and the character, [128] [129] and they regarded his battles as some of the franchise's best. [130] The series finale garnered praise from critics for the intensified rivalry between Naruto and Sasuke because of the characters' similarities. [131] [132] Reviewers also applauded Sasuke's acknowledgement of his crimes, his agreement to go to prison, and his decision to begin a journey of redemption, indicating an acceptance of responsibility for his misdeeds and a response to Sakura's feelings. [133] Writers thought the character's monologue after his final fight with Naruto highlighted his deeper side and that his farewell was a satisfying ending to the final story arc. [134] [135] Sasuke has continued to receive praise following the end of the Naruto series. Writers considered his fight scenes in Boruto: Naruto the Movie and in particular his teamwork with Naruto to be the best parts of the film. [136] [137] [138] [139] A similar assessment was made of Sasuke's characterization as an adult; Chris Beveridge of The Fandom Post approved of his new personality. [140] Critics also commented that Sasuke had become more caring toward his daughter, [141] [142] and they said the Boruto anime had developed Sasuke as a father and a husband and had solidified his relationship with his wife, Sakura, [143] [144] despite his flawed interaction with his family. [145] Scholars have also analyzed the character. According to a study of readers' abilities to predict character types based on physical cues, Sasuke was classified as an ISTJ ( Myers-Briggs ) character type, making him a foil for Naruto. [146] Rik Spanjers regarded Sasuke's dissimilarity to Naruto as tragic but wrote that the contrast between the protagonists' approaches to the world was fundamental to the plot: \"Naruto's strength grows as he gains more loved ones to protect, while Sasuke remains alone and is increasingly absorbed by his quest for revenge\". [147] According to academic Amy Plumb, Kishimoto's references to Japanese mythology in Naruto , including the heraldic symbol of Sasuke's clan \u2014 a fan known as an uchiwa \u2014 added layers to the story and Sasuke's ability to 'blow away' the Nine-Tailed Fox's influence on Naruto resembled the mythological use of the fan to dispel evil.

{"question": "how long is training camp for nfl players", "answer": "several different ways. New players and", "context": "Training camp (National Football League) - Wikipedia Training camp (National Football League) From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search For the Wii video game , see EA Sports Active NFL Training Camp . This article needs additional citations for verification . Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (September 2014) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) The San Francisco 49ers conducting training camp at the team's headquarters and practice facility in Santa Clara, California in August 2010 In the National Football League , training camp refers to the time before the season commences. During this time, teams will sometimes congregate at an outside location, usually a university, to conduct training camp for at least the first few weeks. This is similar to baseball 's spring training . Training camp is used in several different ways. New players and coaches use it to acclimate themselves to new teammates and systems. For younger players, it serves as a period of evaluation; for veterans, it is time to round back into form. Training camp is divided into several different components. The first is scrimmages. These are pseudo-games where teams run nearly full games' worth of plays. Sometimes, two practice sessions are held on the same day. This concept is referred to as two-a-days . Other parts of training camp include drills, meetings with coaches and other players at one's position, weight training , and pre-season games. The latter half of training camp leads directly into the exhibition season . With NFL training camps starting in late-July, the biggest concern has been dehydration. In 2001, Minnesota Vikings player Korey Stringer died of a medical condition based from dehydration and heatstroke . The death of Stringer prompted the NFL to change their training policies. At each practice, every team must have the team doctor and trainers on the field; additionally, an ambulance must be present during practices. With NFL training camps beginning in late July, severe weather can affect practice and exhibition games. In 2002, a Cleveland Browns exhibition game ended due to lightning near Cleveland Browns Stadium , and severe storms have been known to disrupt training camps. Fans are often able to visit their favorite team's training camp to catch an early look at the players; admission to practices is often free or substantially less expensive than a game ticket, making training camp trips a popular option for fans who cannot attend many games due to financial or other reasons. NFL teams often sell souvenirs and concessions at camp sites along with offering activities and events to make training camp a more fan-friendly experience. Official NFL training camps should be distinguished from private training camps, often for certain tactics or positions. [1] Contents [ hide ] 1 Organized team activities 2 Training camp sites by team 3 Differences with baseball 4 See also 5 Notes 6 External links Organized team activities [ edit ] Recently the NFL has let teams have off-season training sessions, officially called \"organized team activities\" (OTAs). Many teams use the OTAs to help develop players and make them better. These training sessions are in late April and early May. The OTAs are the only practices between the end of the previous season and the start of training camp. Players new to the NFL attend seminars and lectures organized by the NFL from mid-June to mid-July. For veteran players, they use the off-time to sponsor football camps for children, golf outings for charity, or even some family time.

However, an increasing number of teams do so in the same facilities at which they practice all year long - 19 teams in 2014, and 20 in 2015, up from five in 2000. [2] Most teams have abandoned remote locations to \"come home\" for training camp, largely for practicality reasons. Many clubs have recently constructed state-of-the-art practice facilities, replete with amenities (practice fields, indoor practice fields, weightlifting rooms, meeting rooms, film study rooms, cafeteria, medical facilities, IT infrastructure, etc.) that can not be provided or matched at other distant locations (colleges, parks, etc.) In addition, the cost of temporarily relocating and accommodating the entire team organization to another location is substantial. [3] The attitudes about how to run training camp have also evolved - leading more teams to stay home. With Organized Team Activities (\"OTAs\"), mini-camps, and conditioning during the off-season, players remain in top physical shape year-round. The focus of training camp is no longer getting players back in shape, but more of fostering camaraderie. For example, the Lions' camp was long held at Saginaw Valley State College , the Broncos trained at the University of Northern Colorado , the Patriots at Bryant University in Smithfield, Rhode Island , and the Redskins moved in from Dickinson College , the former site of Carlisle Indian School . Tampa Bay used to train at the University of Tampa , then at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex before moving permanently back to their headquarters. Similarly, after many years on the road, the Jets ( SUNY Cortland ) and the Giants ( Albany ) both recently moved back to team headquarters. There are still a handful of teams that use somewhat distant locations at the fringes of their markets to promote their team. For instance, the Buffalo Bills moved their training camp from SUNY Fredonia to Saint John Fisher College in suburban Rochester ; as a team representing one of the smallest cities in the NFL, the holding of training camp in the nearby city of Rochester allows the Bills to lay claim to a larger portion of upstate New York and thus take advantage of a market closer in size to other teams in the NFL (similar rationale was used for the Bills' games in Toronto, Ontario, Canada prior to 2014). The Dallas Cowboys have historically hosted their training camp in locales very distant from their home market, even before they were given the moniker \" America's Team \" in the late 1970s; from 2001 to 2015, the Cowboys held their training camp at the River Ridge Playing Fields in Oxnard, California , a suburb of Los Angeles. The Cowboys' arrangement with Oxnard ended when the Los Angeles Rams returned to southern California and the Cowboys constructed their own facility closer to Dallas. Another difference between spring training and training camp is that true intra-squad games do not take place (anymore), though informal scrimmages are very common. Split-squad games never happen in the NFL. It is also fairly common to see two teams hold a short joint camp and scrimmage at a neutral site in addition to their main camp.

{"question": "where do some of the natural air pollutants come from", "answer": "", "context": "Air pollution - Wikipedia Air pollution From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search \"Bad air quality\" and \"Air quality\" redirect here. For the obsolete medical theory, see Bad air . For the measure of how polluted the air is, see Air quality index . For the properties of air, see Qualities of air . Air pollution from a coking oven . Air pollution occurs when harmful substances including particulates and biological molecules are introduced into Earth's atmosphere . It may cause diseases, allergies or death of humans; it may also cause harm to other living organisms such as animals and food crops, and may damage the natural or built environment . Human activity and natural processes can both generate air pollution. Indoor air pollution and poor urban air quality are listed as two of the world's worst toxic pollution problems in the 2008 Blacksmith Institute World's Worst Polluted Places report. [1] According to the 2014 World Health Organization report, air pollution in 2012 caused the deaths of around 7 million people worldwide, [2] an estimate roughly echoed by one from the International Energy Agency .

The substance can be solid particles, liquid droplets, or gases. A pollutant can be of natural origin or man-made. Pollutants are classified as primary or secondary. Primary pollutants are usually produced from a process, such as ash from a volcanic eruption. Other examples include carbon monoxide gas from motor vehicle exhaust, or the sulfur dioxide released from factories. Secondary pollutants are not emitted directly. Rather, they form in the air when primary pollutants react or interact. Ground level ozone is a prominent example of a secondary pollutant. Some pollutants may be both primary and secondary: they are both emitted directly and formed from other primary pollutants. Before flue-gas desulfurization was installed, the emissions from this power plant in New Mexico contained excessive amounts of sulfur dioxide . Schematic drawing, causes and effects of air pollution: (1) greenhouse effect, (2) particulate contamination, (3) increased UV radiation, (4) acid rain, (5) increased ground level ozone concentration, (6) increased levels of nitrogen oxides. Thermal oxidizers are air pollution abatement options for hazardous air pollutants (HAPs), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and odorous emissions. Substances emitted into the atmosphere by human activity include: Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) - Because of its role as a greenhouse gas it has been described as \"the leading pollutant\" [5] and \"the worst climate pollution\". [6] Carbon dioxide is a natural component of the atmosphere, essential for plant life and given off by the human respiratory system . [7] This question of terminology has practical effects, for example as determining whether the U.S. Clean Air Act is deemed to regulate CO 2 emissions. [8] CO 2 currently forms about 405 parts per million (ppm) of earth's atmosphere, compared to about 280 ppm in pre-industrial times, [9] and billions of metric tons of CO 2 are emitted annually by burning of fossil fuels . [10] CO 2 increase in earth's atmosphere has been accelerating. [11] Sulfur oxides (SO x ) - particularly sulfur dioxide, a chemical compound with the formula SO 2 . SO 2 is produced by volcanoes and in various industrial processes. Coal and petroleum often contain sulfur compounds, and their combustion generates sulfur dioxide. Further oxidation of SO 2 , usually in the presence of a catalyst such as NO 2 , forms H 2 SO 4 , and thus acid rain .[2] This is one of the causes for concern over the environmental impact of the use of these fuels as power sources. Nitrogen oxides (NO x ) - Nitrogen oxides, particularly nitrogen dioxide , are expelled from high temperature combustion, and are also produced during thunderstorms by electric discharge . They can be seen as a brown haze dome above or a plume downwind of cities. Nitrogen dioxide is a chemical compound with the formula NO 2 . It is one of several nitrogen oxides. One of the most prominent air pollutants, this reddish-brown toxic gas has a characteristic sharp, biting odor. Carbon monoxide (CO) - CO is a colorless, odorless, toxic yet non-irritating gas. It is a product of combustion of fuel such as natural gas, coal or wood. Vehicular exhaust contributes to the majority of carbon monoxide let into our atmosphere. It creates a smog type formation in the air that has been linked to many lung diseases and disruptions to the natural environment and animals. In 2013, more than half of the carbon monoxide emitted into our atmosphere was from vehicle traffic and burning one gallon of gas will often emit over 20 pounds of carbon monoxide into the air. [12] Volatile organic compounds (VOC) - VOCs are a well-known outdoor air pollutant. They are categorized as either methane (CH 4 ) or non-methane (NMVOCs). Methane is an extremely efficient greenhouse gas which contributes to enhanced global warming . Other hydrocarbon VOCs are also significant greenhouse gases because of their role in creating ozone and prolonging the life of methane in the atmosphere . This effect varies depending on local air quality. The aromatic NMVOCs benzene, toluene and xylene are suspected carcinogens and may lead to leukemia with prolonged exposure. 1,3-butadiene is another dangerous compound often associated with industrial use. Particulates , alternatively referred to as particulate matter (PM), atmospheric particulate matter, or fine particles, are tiny particles of solid or liquid suspended in a gas. In contrast, aerosol refers to combined particles and gas. Some particulates occur naturally, originating from volcanoes, dust storms, forest and grassland fires, living vegetation, and sea spray. Human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels in vehicles, power plants and various industrial processes also generate significant amounts of aerosols. Averaged worldwide, anthropogenic aerosols\u2014those made by human activities\u2014currently account for approximately 10 percent of our atmosphere. Increased levels of fine particles in the air are linked to health hazards such as heart disease, [13] altered lung function and lung cancer. Particulates are related to respiratory infections and can be particularly harmful to those already suffering from conditions like asthma . [14] Persistent free radicals connected to airborne fine particles are linked to cardiopulmonary disease. [15] [16] Toxic metals , such as lead and mercury , especially their compounds. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) - harmful to the ozone layer ; emitted from products are currently banned from use. These are gases which are released from air conditioners, refrigerators, aerosol sprays, etc. On release into the air, CFCs rise to the stratosphere . Here they come in contact with other gases and damage the ozone layer . This allows harmful ultraviolet rays to reach the earth's surface. This can lead to skin cancer, eye disease and can even cause damage to plants. Ammonia (NH 3 ) - emitted from agricultural processes. Ammonia is a compound with the formula NH 3 . It is normally encountered as a gas with a characteristic pungent odor. Ammonia contributes significantly to the nutritional needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to foodstuffs and fertilizers. Ammonia, either directly or indirectly, is also a building block for the synthesis of many pharmaceuticals. Although in wide use, ammonia is both caustic and hazardous. In the atmosphere, ammonia reacts with oxides of nitrogen and sulfur to form secondary particles. [17] Odours \u2014 such as from garbage, sewage, and industrial processes Radioactive pollutants - produced by nuclear explosions , nuclear events, war explosives , and natural processes such as the radioactive decay of radon . Secondary pollutants include: Particulates created from gaseous primary pollutants and compounds in photochemical smog. Smog is a kind of air pollution. Classic smog results from large amounts of coal burning in an area caused by a mixture of smoke and sulfur dioxide. Modern smog does not usually come from coal but from vehicular and industrial emissions that are acted on in the atmosphere by ultraviolet light from the sun to form secondary pollutants that also combine with the primary emissions to form photochemical smog. Ground level ozone (O 3 ) formed from NO x and VOCs. Ozone (O 3 ) is a key constituent of the troposphere. It is also an important constituent of certain regions of the stratosphere commonly known as the Ozone layer. Photochemical and chemical reactions involving it drive many of the chemical processes that occur in the atmosphere by day and by night. At abnormally high concentrations brought about by human activities (largely the combustion of fossil fuel), it is a pollutant, and a constituent of smog. Peroxyacetyl nitrate (C 2 H 3 NO 5 ) - similarly formed from NO x and VOCs. Minor air pollutants include: A large number of minor hazardous air pollutants . Some of these are regulated in USA under the Clean Air Act and in Europe under the Air Framework Directive A variety of persistent organic pollutants , which can attach to particulates Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are organic compounds that are resistant to environmental degradation through chemical, biological, and photolytic processes. Because of this, they have been observed to persist in the environment, to be capable of long-range transport, bioaccumulate in human and animal tissue, biomagnify in food chains, and to have potentially significant impacts on human health and the environment. Sources [ edit ] Play media This video provides an overview of a NASA study on the human fingerprint on global air quality. There are various locations, activities or factors which are responsible for releasing pollutants into the atmosphere. These sources can be classified into two major categories. Anthropogenic (man-made) sources [ edit ] Controlled burning of a field outside of Statesboro , Georgia in preparation for spring planting. These are mostly related to the burning of multiple types of fuel. Stationary sources include smoke stacks of fossil fuel power stations , manufacturing facilities (factories) and waste incinerators, as well as furnaces and other types of fuel-burning heating devices. In developing and poor countries, traditional biomass burning is the major source of air pollutants; traditional biomass includes wood, crop waste and dung. [18] [19] Mobile sources include motor vehicles , marine vessels, and aircraft. Controlled burn practices in agriculture and forest management. Controlled or prescribed burning is a technique sometimes used in forest management, farming, prairie restoration or greenhouse gas abatement. Fire is a natural part of both forest and grassland ecology and controlled fire can be a tool for foresters. Controlled burning stimulates the germination of some desirable forest trees, thus renewing the forest. Fumes from paint , hair spray , varnish , aerosol sprays and other solvents Waste deposition in landfills , which generate methane . Methane is highly flammable and may form explosive mixtures with air. Methane is also an asphyxiant and may displace oxygen in an enclosed space. Asphyxia or suffocation may result if the oxygen concentration is reduced to below 19.5% by displacement. Military resources, such as nuclear weapons , toxic gases , germ warfare and rocketry . Natural sources [ edit ] Dust storm approaching Stratford, Texas . Dust from natural sources, usually large areas of land with little or no vegetation Methane , emitted by the digestion of food by animals , for example cattle Radon gas from radioactive decay within the Earth's crust . Radon is a colorless, odorless, naturally occurring, radioactive noble gas that is formed from the decay of radium. It is considered to be a health hazard. Radon gas from natural sources can accumulate in buildings, especially in confined areas such as the basement and it is the second most frequent cause of lung cancer, after cigarette smoking. Smoke and carbon monoxide from wildfires Vegetation, in some regions, emits environmentally significant amounts of Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on warmer days. These VOCs react with primary anthropogenic pollutants\u2014specifically, NO x , SO 2 , and anthropogenic organic carbon compounds \u2014 to produce a seasonal haze of secondary pollutants. [20] Black gum, poplar, oak and willow are some examples of vegetation that can produce abundant VOCs. The VOC production from these species result in ozone levels up to eight times higher than the low-impact tree species. [21] Volcanic activity, which produces sulfur , chlorine , and ash particulates Emission factors [ edit ] Main article: AP 42 Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors Beijing air on a 2005-day after rain (left) and a smoggy day (right) Air pollutant emission factors are reported representative values that attempt to relate the quantity of a pollutant released to the ambient air with an activity associated with the release of that pollutant. These factors are usually expressed as the weight of pollutant divided by a unit weight, volume, distance, or duration of the activity emitting the pollutant (e.g., kilograms of particulate emitted per tonne of coal burned). Such factors facilitate estimation of emissions from various sources of air pollution. In most cases, these factors are simply averages of all available data of acceptable quality, and are generally assumed to be representative of long-term averages. There are 12 compounds in the list of persistent organic pollutants . Dioxins and furans are two of them and intentionally created by combustion of organics, like open burning of plastics. These compounds are also endocrine disruptors and can mutate the human genes. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has published a compilation of air pollutant emission factors for a wide range of industrial sources. [22] The United Kingdom , Australia , Canada and many other countries have published similar compilations, as well as the European Environment Agency . [23] [24] [25] [26] Exposure [ edit ] Air pollution risk is a function of the hazard of the pollutant and the exposure to that pollutant. Air pollution exposure can be expressed for an individual, for certain groups (e.g. neighborhoods or children living in a country), or for entire populations. For example, one may want to calculate the exposure to a hazardous air pollutant for a geographic area, which includes the various microenvironments and age groups. This can be calculated [27] as an inhalation exposure. This would account for daily exposure in various settings (e.g. different indoor micro-environments and outdoor locations). The exposure needs to include different age and other demographic groups, especially infants, children, pregnant women and other sensitive subpopulations. The exposure to an air pollutant must integrate the concentrations of the air pollutant with respect to the time spent in each setting and the respective inhalation rates for each subgroup for each specific time that the subgroup is in the setting and engaged in particular activities (playing, cooking, reading, working, etc.). For example, a small child's inhalation rate will be less than that of an adult. A child engaged in vigorous exercise will have a higher respiration rate than the same child in a sedentary activity. The daily exposure, then, needs to reflect the time spent in each micro-environmental setting and the type of activities in these settings. The air pollutant concentration in each microactivity/microenvironmental setting is summed to indicate the exposure. [27] Indoor air quality (IAQ) [ edit ] Main article: Indoor air quality Air quality monitoring, New Delhi, India . A lack of ventilation indoors concentrates air pollution where people often spend the majority of their time. Radon (Rn) gas, a carcinogen , is exuded from the Earth in certain locations and trapped inside houses. Building materials including carpeting and plywood emit formaldehyde (H 2 CO) gas. Paint and solvents give off volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as they dry. Lead paint can degenerate into dust and be inhaled. Intentional air pollution is introduced with the use of air fresheners , incense , and other scented items. Controlled wood fires in stoves and fireplaces can add significant amounts of smoke particulates into the air, inside and out. [28] Indoor pollution fatalities may be caused by using pesticides and other chemical sprays indoors without proper ventilation. Carbon monoxide poisoning and fatalities are often caused by faulty vents and chimneys, or by the burning of charcoal indoors or in a confined space, such as a tent. [29] Chronic carbon monoxide poisoning can result even from poorly-adjusted pilot lights . Traps are built into all domestic plumbing to keep sewer gas and hydrogen sulfide , out of interiors. Clothing emits tetrachloroethylene , or other dry cleaning fluids, for days after dry cleaning . Though its use has now been banned in many countries, the extensive use of asbestos in industrial and domestic environments in the past has left a potentially very dangerous material in many localities. Asbestosis is a chronic inflammatory medical condition affecting the tissue of the lungs . It occurs after long-term, heavy exposure to asbestos from asbestos-containing materials in structures. Sufferers have severe dyspnea (shortness of breath) and are at an increased risk regarding several different types of lung cancer . As clear explanations are not always stressed in non-technical literature, care should be taken to distinguish between several forms of relevant diseases. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) , these may defined as; asbestosis , lung cancer , and Peritoneal Mesothelioma (generally a very rare form of cancer, when more widespread it is almost always associated with prolonged exposure to asbestos). Biological sources of air pollution are also found indoors, as gases and airborne particulates. Pets produce dander, people produce dust from minute skin flakes and decomposed hair, dust mites in bedding, carpeting and furniture produce enzymes and micrometre-sized fecal droppings, inhabitants emit methane, mold forms on walls and generates mycotoxins and spores, air conditioning systems can incubate Legionnaires' disease and mold, and houseplants , soil and surrounding gardens can produce pollen , dust, and mold. Indoors, the lack of air circulation allows these airborne pollutants to accumulate more than they would otherwise occur in nature. Health effects [ edit ] See also: Neuroplastic effects of pollution Air pollution is a significant risk factor for a number of pollution-related diseases and health conditions including respiratory infections, heart disease, COPD , stroke and lung cancer. [2] The health effects caused by air pollution may include difficulty in breathing, wheezing, coughing, asthma and worsening of existing respiratory and cardiac conditions. These effects can result in increased medication use, increased doctor or emergency room visits, more hospital admissions and premature death. The human health effects of poor air quality are far reaching, but principally affect the body's respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. Individual reactions to air pollutants depend on the type of pollutant a person is exposed to, the degree of exposure, and the individual's health status and genetics. [27] The most common sources of air pollution include particulates, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide. Children aged less than five years that live in developing countries are the most vulnerable population in terms of total deaths attributable to indoor and outdoor air pollution. [30] Mortality [ edit ] The World Health Organization estimated in 2014 that every year air pollution causes the premature death of some 7 million people worldwide. [2] India has the highest death rate due to air pollution. [31] India also has more deaths from asthma than any other nation according to the World Health Organization. In December 2013 air pollution was estimated to kill 500,000 people in China each year. [32] There is a positive correlation between pneumonia -related deaths and air pollution from motor vehicle emissions. [33] Annual premature European deaths caused by air pollution are estimated at 430,000. [34] An important cause of these deaths is nitrogen dioxide and other nitrogen oxides (NOx) emitted by road vehicles. [34] In a 2015 consultation document the UK government disclosed that nitrogen dioxide is responsible for 23,500 premature UK deaths per annum. [35] Across the European Union , air pollution is estimated to reduce life expectancy by almost nine months. [36] Causes of deaths include strokes , heart disease , COPD, lung cancer, and lung infections. [2] Urban outdoor air pollution is estimated to cause 1.3 million deaths worldwide per year. Children are particularly at risk due to the immaturity of their respiratory organ systems. [37] The US EPA estimates that a proposed set of changes in diesel engine technology ( Tier 2 ) could result in 12,000 fewer premature mortalities , 15,000 fewer heart attacks , 6,000 fewer emergency room visits by children with asthma, and 8,900 fewer respiratory-related hospital admissions each year in the United States. [38] The US EPA has estimated that limiting ground-level ozone concentration to 65 parts per billion, would avert 1,700 to 5,100 premature deaths nationwide in 2020 compared with the 75-ppb standard. The agency projected the more protective standard would also prevent an additional 26,000 cases of aggravated asthma, and more than a million cases of missed work or school. [39] [40] Following this assessment, the EPA acted to protect public health by lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ground-level ozone to 70 parts per billion (ppb). [41] A new economic study of the health impacts and associated costs of air pollution in the Los Angeles Basin and San Joaquin Valley of Southern California shows that more than 3,800 people die prematurely (approximately 14 years earlier than normal) each year because air pollution levels violate federal standards. The number of annual premature deaths is considerably higher than the fatalities related to auto collisions in the same area, which average fewer than 2,000 per year. [42] [43] [44] Diesel exhaust (DE) is a major contributor to combustion-derived particulate matter air pollution. In several human experimental studies, using a well-validated exposure chamber setup, DE has been linked to acute vascular dysfunction and increased thrombus formation. [45] [46] The mechanisms linking air pollution to increased cardiovascular mortality are uncertain, but probably include pulmonary and systemic inflammation. [47] Cardiovascular disease [ edit ] A 2007 review of evidence found ambient air pollution exposure is a risk factor correlating with increased total mortality from cardiovascular events (range: 12% to 14% per 10 microg/m 3 increase). [48] Air pollution is also emerging as a risk factor for stroke, particularly in developing countries where pollutant levels are highest. [49] A 2007 study found that in women, air pollution is not associated with hemorrhagic but with ischemic stroke. [50] Air pollution was also found to be associated with increased incidence and mortality from coronary stroke in a cohort study in 2011. [51] Associations are believed to be causal and effects may be mediated by vasoconstriction, low-grade inflammation and atherosclerosis [52] Other mechanisms such as autonomic nervous system imbalance have also been suggested. [53] [54] Lung disease [ edit ] Research has demonstrated increased risk of developing asthma [55] and COPD [56] from increased exposure to traffic-related air pollution. Additionally, air pollution has been associated with increased hospitalization and mortality from asthma and COPD. [57] [58] Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) includes diseases such as chronic bronchitis and emphysema. [59] A study conducted in 1960-1961 in the wake of the Great Smog of 1952 compared 293 London residents with 477 residents of Gloucester, Peterborough, and Norwich, three towns with low reported death rates from chronic bronchitis. All subjects were male postal truck drivers aged 40 to 59. Compared to the subjects from the outlying towns, the London subjects exhibited more severe respiratory symptoms (including cough, phlegm, and dyspnea), reduced lung function ( FEV 1 and peak flow rate), and increased sputum production and purulence. The differences were more pronounced for subjects aged 50 to 59. The study controlled for age and smoking habits, so concluded that air pollution was the most likely cause of the observed differences. [60] More recent studies have shown that air pollution exposure from traffic reduces lung function development in children [61] and lung function may be compromised by air pollution even at low concentrations. [62] Air pollution exposure also cause lung cancer in non smokers. It is believed that much like cystic fibrosis , by living in a more urban environment serious health hazards become more apparent. Studies have shown that in urban areas patients suffer mucus hypersecretion, lower levels of lung function, and more self-diagnosis of chronic bronchitis and emphysema. [63] Cancer [ edit ] Cancer is mainly the result of environmental factors . [64] A review of evidence regarding whether ambient air pollution exposure is a risk factor for cancer in 2007 found solid data to conclude that long-term exposure to PM2.5 (fine particulates) increases the overall risk of non-accidental mortality by 6% per a 10 microg/m 3 increase. Exposure to PM2.5 was also associated with an increased risk of mortality from lung cancer (range: 15% to 21% per 10 microg/m 3 increase) and total cardiovascular mortality (range: 12% to 14% per a 10 microg/m 3 increase). The review further noted that living close to busy traffic appears to be associated with elevated risks of these three outcomes --- increase in lung cancer deaths, cardiovascular deaths, and overall non-accidental deaths. The reviewers also found suggestive evidence that exposure to PM2.5 is positively associated with mortality from coronary heart diseases and exposure to SO 2 increases mortality from lung cancer, but the data was insufficient to provide solid conclusions. [65] Another investigation showed that higher activity level increases deposition fraction of aerosol particles in human lung and recommended avoiding heavy activities like running in outdoor space at polluted areas. [66] In 2011, a large Danish epidemiological study found an increased risk of lung cancer for patients who lived in areas with high nitrogen oxide concentrations. In this study, the association was higher for non-smokers than smokers. [67] An additional Danish study, also in 2011, likewise noted evidence of possible associations between air pollution and other forms of cancer, including cervical cancer and brain cancer. [68] In December 2015, medical scientists reported that cancer is overwhelmingly a result of environmental factors , and not largely down to bad luck. [64] Maintaining a healthy weight, eating a healthy diet, minimizing alcohol and eliminating smoking reduces the risk of developing the disease, according to the researchers. [64] Children [ edit ] In the United States, despite the passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970, in 2002 at least 146 million Americans were living in non-attainment areas \u2014regions in which the concentration of certain air pollutants exceeded federal standards. [69] These dangerous pollutants are known as the criteria pollutants , and include ozone, particulate matter , sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and lead. Protective measures to ensure children's health are being taken in cities such as New Delhi , India where buses now use compressed natural gas to help eliminate the \"pea-soup\" smog. [70] A recent study in Europe has found that exposure to ultrafine particles can increase blood pressure in children. [71] Infants [ edit ] Ambient levels of air pollution have been associated with preterm birth and low birth weight. A 2014 WHO worldwide survey on maternal and perinatal health found a statistically significant association between low birth weights (LBW) and increased levels of exposure to PM2.5. Women in regions with greater than average PM2.5 levels had statistically significant higher odds of pregnancy resulting in a low-birth weight infant even when adjusted for country-related variables. [72] The effect is thought to be from stimulating inflammation and increasing oxidative stress. A study by the University of York found that in 2010 exposure to PM2.5 was strongly associated with 18% of preterm births globally, which was approximately 2.7 million premature births. The countries with the highest air pollution associated preterm births were in South and East Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, and West sub-Saharan Africa. [73] The source of PM 2.5 differs greatly by region. In South and East Asia, pregnant women are frequently exposed to indoor air pollution because of the wood and other biomass fuels used for cooking which are responsible for more than 80% of regional pollution. In the Middle East, North Africa and West sub-Saharan Africa, fine PM comes from natural sources, such as dust storms. [73] The United States had an estimated 50,000 preterm births associated with exposure to PM2.5 in 2010. [73] A study performed by Wang, et al. between the years of 1988 and 1991 has found a correlation between Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) and total suspended particulates (TSP) and preterm births and low birth weights in Beijing. A group of 74,671 pregnant women, in four separate regions of Beijing, were monitored from early pregnancy to delivery along with daily air pollution levels of Sulfur Dioxide and TSP (along with other particulates). The estimated reduction in birth weight was 7.3 g for every 100\u00a0\u00b5g/m3 increase in SO2 and 6.9g for each 100\u00a0\u00b5g/m3 increase in TSP. These associations were statistically significant in both summer and winter, although, summer was greater. The proportion of low birth weight attributable to air pollution, was 13%. This is the largest attributable risk ever reported for the known risk factors of low birth weight. [74] Coal stoves, which are in 97% of homes, are a major source of air pollution in this area. Brauer et al. studied the relationship between air pollution and proximity to a highway with pregnancy outcomes in a Vancouver cohort of pregnant woman using addresses to estimate exposure during pregnancy. Exposure to NO, NO2, CO PM10 and PM2.5 were associated with infants born small for gestational age (SGA). Women living <50meters away from an expressway or highway were 26% more likely to give birth to a SGA infant. [75] \"Clean\" areas [ edit ] Even in the areas with relatively low levels of air pollution, public health effects can be significant and costly, since a large number of people breathe in such pollutants. A 2005 scientific study for the British Columbia Lung Association showed that a small improvement in air quality (1% reduction of ambient PM2.5 and ozone concentrations) would produce $29 million in annual savings in the Metro Vancouver region in 2010. [76] This finding is based on health valuation of lethal (death) and sub-lethal (illness) affects. Central nervous system [ edit ] Data is accumulating that air pollution exposure also affects the central nervous system . [77] In a June 2014 study conducted by researchers at the University of Rochester Medical Center, published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives , it was discovered that early exposure to air pollution causes the same damaging changes in the brain as autism and schizophrenia . The study also shows that air pollution also affected short-term memory, learning ability, and impulsivity. Lead researcher Professor Deborah Cory-Slechta said that \"When we looked closely at the ventricles, we could see that the white matter that normally surrounds them hadn't fully developed. It appears that inflammation had damaged those brain cells and prevented that region of the brain from developing, and the ventricles simply expanded to fill the space. Our findings add to the growing body of evidence that air pollution may play a role in autism, as well as in other neurodevelopmental disorders.\" Air pollution has a more significant negative effect on males than on females. [78] [79] In 2015, experimental studies reported the detection of significant episodic (situational) cognitive impairment from impurities in indoor air breathed by test subjects who were not informed about changes in the air quality. Researchers at the Harvard University and SUNY Upstate Medical University and Syracuse University measured the cognitive performance of 24 participants in three different controlled laboratory atmospheres that simulated those found in \"conventional\" and \"green\" buildings, as well as green buildings with enhanced ventilation. Performance was evaluated objectively using the widely used Strategic Management Simulation software simulation tool, which is a well-validated assessment test for executive decision-making in an unconstrained situation allowing initiative and improvisation. Significant deficits were observed in the performance scores achieved in increasing concentrations of either volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or carbon dioxide , while keeping other factors constant. The highest impurity levels reached are not uncommon in some classroom or office environments. [80] [81] Agricultural effects [ edit ] In India in 2014, it was reported that air pollution by black carbon and ground level ozone had cut crop yields in the most affected areas by almost half in 2010 when compared to 1980 levels. [82] Economic effects [ edit ] Air pollution costs the world economy $5 trillion per year as a result of productivity losses and degraded quality of life, according to a joint study by the World Bank and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington [83] [84] These productivity losses are caused by deaths due to diseases caused by air pollution. One out of ten deaths in 2013 was caused by diseases associated with air pollution and the problem is getting worse. The problem is even more acute in the developing world . \"Children under age 5 in lower-income countries are more than 60 times as likely to die from exposure to air pollution as children in high-income countries.\" [83] [84] The report states that additional economic losses caused by air pollution, including health costs and the adverse effect on agricultural and other productivity were not calculated in the report, and thus the actual costs to the world economy are far higher than $5 trillion. Historical disasters [ edit ] The world's worst short-term civilian pollution crisis was the 1984 Bhopal Disaster in India . [85] Leaked industrial vapours from the Union Carbide factory, belonging to Union Carbide, Inc., U.S.A. (later bought by Dow Chemical Company ), killed at least 3787 people and injured from 150,000 to 600,000. The United Kingdom suffered its worst air pollution event when the December 4 Great Smog of 1952 formed over London . In six days more than 4,000 died and more recent estimates put the figure at nearer 12,000. [86] An accidental leak of anthrax spores from a biological warfare laboratory in the former USSR in 1979 near Sverdlovsk is believed to have caused at least 64 deaths. [87] The worst single incident of air pollution to occur in the US occurred in Donora, Pennsylvania in late October, 1948, when 20 people died and over 7,000 were injured. [88] Alternatives to pollution [ edit ] There are now practical alternatives to the principal causes of air pollution: Areas downwind (over 20 miles) of major airports more than double total particulate emissions in air , even when factoring in areas with frequent ship calls, and heavy freeway and city traffic like Los Angeles. [89] Aviation biofuel mixed in with jetfuel at a 50/50 ratio can reduce jet derived cruise altitude particulate emissions by 50-70%, according to a NASA led 2017 study (however, this should imply ground level benefits to urban air pollution as well). [90] Ship propulsion and idling can be switched to much cleaner fuels like natural gas. (Ideally a renewable source but not practical yet) Combustion of fossil fuels for space heating can be replaced by using ground source heat pumps and seasonal thermal energy storage . [91] Electric power generation from burning fossil fuels can be replaced by power generation from nuclear and renewables. For poor nations, heating and home stoves that contribute much to regional air pollution can be replaced by a much cleaner fossil fuel like natural gas, or ideally, renewables. Motor vehicles driven by fossil fuels, a key factor in urban air pollution, can be replaced by electric vehicles. Though lithium supply and cost is a limitation, there are alternatives. Herding more people into clean public transit such as electric trains can also help. Nevertheless, even in emission-free electric vehicles, rubber tires produce significant amounts of air pollution themselves, ranking as 13th worst pollutant in Los Angeles. [92] Biodigesters can be utilized in poor nations where slash and burn is prevalent, turning a useless commodity into a source of income. The plants can be gathered and sold to a central authority that will break it down in a large modern biodigester, producing much needed energy to use. Induced humidity and ventilation both can greatly dampen air pollution in enclosed spaces, which was found to be relatively high inside subway lines due to braking and friction and relatively less ironically inside transit buses than lower sitting passenger automobiles or subways. [93] Reduction efforts [ edit ] There are various air pollution control technologies and strategies available to reduce air pollution. [94] [95] At its most basic level, land-use planning is likely to involve zoning and transport infrastructure planning. In most developed countries, land-use planning is an important part of social policy, ensuring that land is used efficiently for the benefit of the wider economy and population, as well as to protect the environment. Because a large share of air pollution is caused by combustion of fossil fuels such as coal and oil , the reduction of these fuels can reduce air pollution drastically. Most effective is the switch to clean power sources such as wind power , solar power , hydro power which don't cause air pollution. [96] Efforts to reduce pollution from mobile sources includes primary regulation (many developing countries have permissive regulations), [ citation needed ] expanding regulation to new sources (such as cruise and transport ships, farm equipment, and small gas-powered equipment such as string trimmers , chainsaws , and snowmobiles ), increased fuel efficiency (such as through the use of hybrid vehicles ), conversion to cleaner fuels or conversion to electric vehicles . Titanium dioxide has been researched for its ability to reduce air pollution. Ultraviolet light will release free electrons from material, thereby creating free radicals, which break up VOCs and NOx gases. One form is superhydrophilic . [97] In 2014, Prof. Tony Ryan and Prof. Simon Armitage of University of Sheffield prepared a 10 meter by 20 meter-sized poster coated with microscopic, pollution-eating nanoparticles of titanium dioxide. Placed on a building, this giant poster can absorb the toxic emission from around 20 cars each day. [98] A very effective means to reduce air pollution is the transition to renewable energy . According to a study published in Energy and Environmental Science in 2015 the switch to 100% renewable energy in the United States would eliminate about 62,000 premature mortalities per year and about 42,000 in 2050, if no biomass were used. This would save about $600 billion in health costs a year due to reduced air pollution in 2050, or about 3.6% of the 2014 U.S. gross domestic product. [96] Control devices [ edit ] The following items are commonly used as pollution control devices in industry and transportation. They can either destroy contaminants or remove them from an exhaust stream before it is emitted into the atmosphere. Particulate control Mechanical collectors ( dust cyclones , multicyclones) Electrostatic precipitators An electrostatic precipitator (ESP), or electrostatic air cleaner is a particulate collection device that removes particles from a flowing gas (such as air), using the force of an induced electrostatic charge. Electrostatic precipitators are highly efficient filtration devices that minimally impede the flow of gases through the device, and can easily remove fine particulates such as dust and smoke from the air stream. Baghouses Designed to handle heavy dust loads, a dust collector consists of a blower, dust filter, a filter-cleaning system, and a dust receptacle or dust removal system (distinguished from air cleaners which utilize disposable filters to remove the dust). Particulate scrubbers Wet scrubber is a form of pollution control technology. The term describes a variety of devices that use pollutants from a furnace flue gas or from other gas streams. In a wet scrubber, the polluted gas stream is brought into contact with the scrubbing liquid, by spraying it with the liquid, by forcing it through a pool of liquid, or by some other contact method, so as to remove the pollutants. Scrubbers Baffle spray scrubber Cyclonic spray scrubber Ejector venturi scrubber Mechanically aided scrubber Spray tower Wet scrubber NOx control Low NOx burners Selective catalytic reduction (SCR) Selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR) NOx scrubbers Exhaust gas recirculation Catalytic converter (also for VOC control) VOC abatement Adsorption systems , using activated carbon , such as Fluidized Bed Concentrator Flares Thermal oxidizers Catalytic converters Biofilters Absorption (scrubbing) Cryogenic condensers Vapor recovery systems Acid Gas / SO 2 control Wet scrubbers Dry scrubbers Flue-gas desulfurization Mercury control Sorbent Injection Technology Electro-Catalytic Oxidation (ECO) K-Fuel Dioxin and furan control Miscellaneous associated equipment Source capturing systems Continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS) Regulations [ edit ] Smog in Cairo Main article: Air quality law In general, there are two types of air quality standards. The first class of standards (such as the U.S. National Ambient Air Quality Standards and E.U. Air Quality Directive ) set maximum atmospheric concentrations for specific pollutants. Environmental agencies enact regulations which are intended to result in attainment of these target levels. The second class (such as the North American Air Quality Index ) take the form of a scale with various thresholds, which is used to communicate to the public the relative risk of outdoor activity. The scale may or may not distinguish between different pollutants. Canada [ edit ] In Canada, air pollution and associated health risks are measured with the Air Quality Health Index or (AQHI). It is a health protection tool used to make decisions to reduce short-term exposure to air pollution by adjusting activity levels during increased levels of air pollution. The Air Quality Health Index or \"AQHI\" is a federal program jointly coordinated by Health Canada and Environment Canada . However, the AQHI program would not be possible without the commitment and support of the provinces, municipalities and NGOs. From air quality monitoring to health risk communication and community engagement, local partners are responsible for the vast majority of work related to AQHI implementation. The AQHI provides a number from 1 to 10+ to indicate the level of health risk associated with local air quality. Occasionally, when the amount of air pollution is abnormally high, the number may exceed 10. The AQHI provides a local air quality current value as well as a local air quality maximums forecast for today, tonight and tomorrow and provides associated health advice. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 + Risk: Low (1-3) Moderate (4-6) High (7-10) Very high (above 10) As it is now known that even low levels of air pollution can trigger discomfort for the sensitive population, the index has been developed as a continuum: The higher the number, the greater the health risk and need to take precautions. The index describes the level of health risk associated with this number as 'low', 'moderate', 'high' or 'very high', and suggests steps that can be taken to reduce exposure. [99] Health Risk Air Quality Health Index Health Messages [100] At Risk population General Population Low 1-3 Enjoy your usual outdoor activities. Ideal air quality for outdoor activities Moderate 4-6 Consider reducing or rescheduling strenuous activities outdoors if you are experiencing symptoms. No need to modify your usual outdoor activities unless you experience symptoms such as coughing and throat irritation. High 7-10 Reduce or reschedule strenuous activities outdoors. Children and the elderly should also take it easy. Consider reducing or rescheduling strenuous activities outdoors if you experience symptoms such as coughing and throat irritation. Very high Above 10 Avoid strenuous activities outdoors. Children and the elderly should also avoid outdoor physical exertion and should stay indoors. Reduce or reschedule strenuous activities outdoors, especially if you experience symptoms such as coughing and throat irritation. The measurement is based on the observed relationship of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO 2 ), ground-level Ozone (O 3 ) and particulates (PM 2.5 ) with mortality, from an analysis of several Canadian cities. Significantly, all three of these pollutants can pose health risks, even at low levels of exposure, especially among those with pre-existing health problems. When developing the AQHI, Health Canada's original analysis of health effects included five major air pollutants: particulates, ozone , and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), as well as sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), and carbon monoxide (CO). The latter two pollutants provided little information in predicting health effects and were removed from the AQHI formulation. The AQHI does not measure the effects of odour, pollen , dust, heat or humidity. Germany [ edit ] TA Luft is the German air quality regulation. Hotspots [ edit ] Main article: Toxic Hotspots Air pollution hotspots are areas where air pollution emissions expose individuals to increased negative health effects. [101] They are particularly common in highly populated, urban areas, where there may be a combination of stationary sources (e.g. industrial facilities) and mobile sources (e.g. cars and trucks) of pollution. Emissions from these sources can cause respiratory disease, childhood asthma, cancer, and other health problems. Fine particulate matter such as diesel soot, which contributes to more than 3.2 million premature deaths around the world each year, is a significant problem. It is very small and can lodge itself within the lungs and enter the bloodstream. Diesel soot is concentrated in densely populated areas, and one in six people in the U.S. live near a diesel pollution hot spot. [102] External video AirVisual Earth \u2013 realtime map of global wind and air pollution [103] While air pollution hotspots affect a variety of populations, some groups are more likely to be located in hotspots. Previous studies have shown disparities in exposure to pollution by race and/or income. Hazardous land uses (toxic storage and disposal facilities, manufacturing facilities, major roadways) tend to be located where property values and income levels are low. Low socioeconomic status can be a proxy for other kinds of social vulnerability , including race, a lack of ability to influence regulation and a lack of ability to move to neighborhoods with less environmental pollution. These communities bear a disproportionate burden of environmental pollution and are more likely to face health risks such as cancer or asthma. [104] Studies show that patterns in race and income disparities not only indicate a higher exposure to pollution but also higher risk of adverse health outcomes . [105] Communities characterized by low socioeconomic status and racial minorities can be more vulnerable to cumulative adverse health impacts resulting from elevated exposure to pollutants than more privileged communities. [105] Blacks and Latinos generally face more pollution than whites and Asians, and low-income communities bear a higher burden of risk than affluent ones. [104] Racial discrepancies are particularly distinct in suburban areas of the US South and metropolitan areas of the US West. [106] [ clarification needed ] Residents in public housing, who are generally low-income and cannot move to healthier neighborhoods, are highly affected by nearby refineries and chemical plants. [107] Cities [ edit ] See also: List of most polluted cities in the world by particulate matter concentration The factual accuracy of parts of this article (those related to the first two images in this section) may be compromised due to out-of-date information . Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (October 2013) Nitrogen dioxide concentrations as measured from satellite 2002-2004 Deaths from air pollution in 2004 Air pollution is usually concentrated in densely populated metropolitan areas, especially in developing countries where environmental regulations are relatively lax or nonexistent. [108] However, even populated areas in developed countries attain unhealthy levels of pollution, with Los Angeles and Rome being two examples. [109] Between 2002 and 2011 the incidence of lung cancer in Beijing near doubled. While smoking remains the leading cause of lung cancer in China, the number of smokers is falling while lung cancer rates are rising. [110] Another project focusing on the effects on pollution in vegetation has been researched by the local university in Sheffield, UK . National-scale air toxics assessments 1995\u20132005 [ edit ] The national-scale air toxics assessment (NATA) is an evaluation of air toxics by the U.S. EPA. The EPA has furnished four assessments that characterize nationwide chronic cancer risk estimates and noncancer hazards from inhaling air toxics. The lates was from 2005, and made publicly available in early 2011. \"EPA developed the NATA as a state-of-the-science screening tool for State/Local/Tribal Agencies to prioritize pollutants, emission sources and locations of interest for further study, in order to gain a better understanding of the risks. NATA assessments do not incorporate refined information about emission sources, but rather, use general information about sources to develop estimates of risks which are more likely to overestimate impacts than underestimate them. NATA provides estimates of the risk of cancer and other serious health effects from breathing (inhaling) air toxics in order to inform both national and more localized efforts to identify and prioritize air toxics, emission source types and locations which are of greatest potential concern in terms of contributing to population risk. This in turn helps air pollution experts focus limited analytical resources on areas and or populations where the potential for health risks are highest. Assessments include estimates of cancer and non-cancer health effects based on chronic exposure from outdoor sources, including assessments of non-cancer health effects for Diesel Particulate Matter. Assessments provide a snapshot of the outdoor air quality and the risks to human health that would result if air toxic emissions levels remained unchanged.\" [111] Most polluted cities by PM [112] Particulate matter, \u03bcg/m\u00b3 (2004) City 168 Cairo , Egypt 150 Delhi , India 128 Kolkata , India (Calcutta) 125 Tianjin , China 123 Chongqing , China 109 Kanpur , India 109 Lucknow , India 104 Jakarta , Indonesia 101 Shenyang , China Governing urban air pollution [ edit ] In Europe , Council Directive 96/62/EC on ambient air quality assessment and management provides a common strategy against which member states can \"set objectives for ambient air quality in order to avoid, prevent or reduce harmful effects on human health and the environment . . . and improve air quality where it is unsatisfactory\". [113] On 25 July 2008 in the case Dieter Janecek v Freistaat Bayern CURIA, the European Court of Justice ruled that under this directive [113] citizens have the right to require national authorities to implement a short term action plan that aims to maintain or achieve compliance to air quality limit values. [114] This important case law appears to confirm the role of the EC as centralised regulator to European nation-states as regards air pollution control. It places a supranational legal obligation on the UK to protect its citizens from dangerous levels of air pollution, furthermore superseding national interests with those of the citizen. In 2010, the European Commission (EC) threatened the UK with legal action against the successive breaching of PM10 limit values. [115] The UK government has identified that if fines are imposed, they could cost the nation upwards of \u00a3300 million per year. [116] In March 2011, the Greater London Built-up Area remains the only UK region in breach of the EC's limit values, and has been given 3 months to implement an emergency action plan aimed at meeting the EU Air Quality Directive. [117] The City of London has dangerous levels of PM10 concentrations, estimated to cause 3000 deaths per year within the city. [118] As well as the threat of EU fines, in 2010 it was threatened with legal action for scrapping the western congestion charge zone, which is claimed to have led to an increase in air pollution levels. [119] In response to these charges, Boris Johnson , Mayor of London , has criticised the current need for European cities to communicate with Europe through their nation state's central government , arguing that in future \"A great city like London\" should be permitted to bypass its government and deal directly with the European Commission regarding its air quality action plan. [117] This can be interpreted as recognition that cities can transcend the traditional national government organisational hierarchy and develop solutions to air pollution using global governance networks, for example through transnational relations. Transnational relations include but are not exclusive to national governments and intergovernmental organisations, [120] allowing sub-national actors including cities and regions to partake in air pollution control as independent actors. Particularly promising at present are global city partnerships. [121] These can be built into networks, for example the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group , of which London is a member. The C40 is a public 'non-state' network of the world's leading cities that aims to curb their greenhouse emissions. [121] The C40 has been identified as 'governance from the middle' and is an alternative to intergovernmental policy. [122] It has the potential to improve urban air quality as participating cities \"exchange information, learn from best practices and consequently mitigate carbon dioxide emissions independently from national government decisions\". [121] A criticism of the C40 network is that its exclusive nature limits influence to participating cities and risks drawing resources away from less powerful city and regional actors.

{"question": "who is the pastor of new birth missionary baptist church now", "answer": "7, 2010. \"New", "context": "New Birth Missionary Baptist Church - Wikipedia New Birth Missionary Baptist Church From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search New Birth Missionary Baptist Church is a megachurch in unincorporated DeKalb County , Georgia , near Lithonia . [1] It has embraced a Pentecostal theology not typically found in African-American Baptist churches. The church was founded in 1939 in Scottdale as Travelers Rest Baptist Church. In 1983, it moved to Decatur and adopted its current name. [2] Eddie Long took over as pastor in 1987. At the time, the church had only 300 members. Since his installation, membership has grown to 25,000. [3] In 2002, New Birth was chosen to host the live recording of Dorinda Clark-Cole, and was chosen by the family of rapper and R&B superstar Lisa Left Eye Lopes to host the funeral for the rapper, who was killed in a car accident in La Ceiba, Honduras. In 2003, New Birth planted a branch called \"New Birth Charlotte\" in Charlotte, North Carolina . That church no longer exists, and has since sold its building. Mecklenburg County records show the church defaulted on its payments to Evangelical Christian Credit Union for a $10 million loan. On August 15, 2004 the church opened a branch called \"New Birth Memphis\" in Memphis, Tennessee . The church has since closed and New Birth Memphis no longer exists. [4] Then in the future years, there were more churches such as New Birth Metro, New Birth Knoxville, New Birth Oakland, and New Birth California. In 2006, the church was chosen by the family of Martin Luther King, Jr. to host and officiate the funeral for Mrs. Coretta Scott King , wife of the late civil rights pioneer. [5] The event was attended by four Presidents ( George H. W. Bush , Bill Clinton , George W. Bush and Jimmy Carter ). [6] The church has also been marred by controversy, with four individuals filing separate lawsuits in DeKalb County Superior Court, Georgia alleging that Bishop Long used his pastoral influence to coerce them into a sexual relationship with him when they were teenagers . [7] [8] On January 15, 2017, Bishop Eddie Long died from an aggressive form of cancer according to a statement released by the church. [9] The church then announced Stephen A. Davis, pastor of New Birth Birmingham in Birmingham, Alabama would be Long's successor at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Lithonia while remaining pastor of the Birmingham church.

{"question": "what's the difference between commonwealth and territory", "answer": "", "context": "Commonwealth (U.S. insular area) - Wikipedia Commonwealth (U.S. insular area) From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search This article is about a type of U.S. insular area. For U.S. states that designate themselves as \"Commonwealths\", see Commonwealth (U.S. state) . For other uses, see Commonwealth . Administrative divisions of the United States First level State Federal district Territory ( Commonwealth ) Indian reservation ( List ) / Hawaiian home land / Alaska Native tribal entity / Pueblo / Off-reservation trust land Second level County / Parish / Borough Unorganized Borough / Census area / Villages / District (USVI) / District (AS) Consolidated city-county Independent city Municipality Unorganized atoll State-recognized tribes Third level Cities, towns, and villages Civil township Coterminous municipality Survey township Barrio Chapter Fourth level Ward Other areas Protected areas ( Conservation district , National Monument , National parks ) Congressional district Homeowner association Associated state Military base Federal enclave Unincorporated area Ghost town v t e In the terminology of the United States insular areas , a Commonwealth is a type of organized but unincorporated dependent territory . There are currently two United States insular areas with the status of commonwealth, the Northern Mariana Islands and Puerto Rico . The definition of \"Commonwealth\" according to current U.S. State Department policy (as codified in the department's Foreign Affairs Manual ) reads: \"The term 'Commonwealth' does not describe or provide for any specific political status or relationship. It has, for example, been applied to both states and territories. When used in connection with areas under U.S. sovereignty that are not states, the term broadly describes an area that is self-governing under a constitution of its adoption and whose right of self-government will not be unilaterally withdrawn by Congress.\" [1] Contents [ hide ] 1 Current commonwealths 1.1 Commonwealth of Puerto Rico 1.2 Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands 1.3 Representation in Congress 2 Former commonwealth 2.1 Commonwealth of the Philippines 3 See also 4 References Current commonwealths [ edit ] Commonwealth of Puerto Rico [ edit ] Of the current U.S. insular areas, the term was first used by Puerto Rico in 1952 as its formal name in English (\"Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\"). The formal name in Spanish for Puerto Rico is \"Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico,\" (\"Free Associated State of Puerto Rico\"). The United States acquired the islands of Puerto Rico in 1898 after the Spanish\u2013American War . In 1950, Congress enacted legislation (P.L. 81-600) authorizing Puerto Rico to hold a constitutional convention and in 1952, the people of Puerto Rico ratified a constitution establishing a republican form of government for the island. [2] Puerto Rico's political relationship with the U.S. has been a continuing source of debate in Puerto Rico , the United States Congress , and the United Nations . The issue revolves around whether Puerto Rico should remain a U.S. territory, become a U.S. state, or become an independent country. The debate has spawned several referenda, presidential executive orders and bills in the U.S. Congress. Ultimately the U.S. Congress is the only body empowered to decide the political status of Puerto Rico, as stated under the Territorial Clause. [3] Despite the Spanish translation of the term \"commonwealth\", Puerto Rico's relationship with United States is not a Compact of Free Association (which is the case for the Federated States of Micronesia , Palau , and the Marshall Islands ). As sovereign states, these islands have full right to conduct their own foreign relations, while the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is part of the United States as a territory. The Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico says that in 1952 there was a pact between Puerto Rico and the United States that gave Puerto Rico an autonomous government and removed it from the list of colonies. The territory was organized by the Foraker Act in 1900, which was amended by the Jones\u2013Shafroth Act in 1917. The drafting of the Constitution of Puerto Rico by its residents was authorized by Congress in 1951, and the result approved in 1952. The government of Puerto Rico has held several referenda with the options of U.S. statehood, independence, and commonwealth; the commonwealth option won on the plebiscites held in 1967, 1993, and 1998. [4] In 2012, 54% of the voters did not wish to continue the present territorial status. Of the non-territorial statuses, becoming a US state got 61.16% of the votes, Sovereign Free Associate State got 33.34% and Independence got 5.49%. [5] Puerto Ricans have United States citizenship and vote for a Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico , with voice but without vote, in the United States House of Representatives . With the exception of federal employees (such as employees of the United States Postal Service , Federal Bureau of Investigation , and servicemen in all branches of the military), residents of Puerto Rico generally do not pay federal income taxes (with the exception of Social Security and Medicare taxes) and Puerto Rico has no representation in the Electoral College that ultimately chooses the U.S. president and vice president. Puerto Rico has sports sovereignty, with its own national team at the Olympics and at other international competitions . Puerto Rico also participates in different international organizations such as the Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLA) (associate member), the Organization of Ibero-American States (full member), and the Ibero-American Summit (associate member). [6] Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands [ edit ] In 1976, Congress approved the mutually negotiated Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) in Political Union with the United States . [7] Prior to November 28, 2009, the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) did not apply in the CNMI. Rather, a separate immigration system existed in the CNMI. This system was established under the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America (\"Covenant\"), which was signed in 1975 and codified as 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1801. The Covenant was unilaterally amended by the Consolidated Natural Resources Act of 2008 CNRA approved by the U.S. Congress on May 8, 2008, thus altering the CNMI's immigration system. Specifically, CNRA \u00a7 702(a) amended the Covenant to state that \"the provisions of the 'immigration laws' (as defined in section 101(a)(17) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(17))) shall apply to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.\"2 Further, under CNRA \u00a7 702(a), the \"immigration laws,\" as well as the amendments to the Covenant, \"shall ... supersede and replace all laws, provisions, or programs of the Commonwealth relating to the admission of aliens and the removal of aliens from the Commonwealth.\" [8] Transition to U.S. Immigration Law began November 28, 2009 in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI). CNMI's immigration laws have been replaced by the INA and other U.S. immigration laws. [9] [10] Representation in Congress [ edit ] Main articles: United States House of Representatives \u00a7\u00a0Apportionment , United States Senate , and Delegate (United States Congress) U.S. insular areas are not afforded direct representation in the federal legislature, either in the Senate or in the House of Representatives . Article I, Section 3 of the Constitution provides that each U.S. State is entitled to two Senators, but makes no provision for representation of insular areas in the Senate. Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution apportions seats in the House of Representatives among the U.S. States by population, with each State being entitled to at least one Representative, but makes no provision for representation of insular areas in the House. Insular areas are, however, afforded limited representation in the House by a Delegate who may vote in committee but not on the House floor. [11] Former commonwealth [ edit ] Commonwealth of the Philippines [ edit ] The Commonwealth of the Philippines was an insular area that held commonwealth status from March 24, 1934 until July 4, 1946. The United States recognized the future independence of the Philippines in 1934 but called for a transitional ten-year period from 1934 up to 1944. The Second World War disrupted the schedule and the Philippines became fully independent in 1946.

Modern era began in the late 1970s Characteristics Mixed gender Separate men's & women's championship although no restrictions on women competing against men. Presence Olympic Since 1996 Mountain biking is the sport of riding bicycles off-road, often over rough terrain, using specially designed mountain bikes . Mountain bikes share similarities with other bikes but incorporate features designed to enhance durability and performance in rough terrain. Mountain biking can generally be broken down into multiple categories: cross country , trail riding , all mountain (also referred to as \"Enduro\"), downhill , freeride and dirt jumping . However, the majority of mountain biking falls into the categories of Trail and Cross Country riding styles. The sport requires endurance, core strength and balance, bike handling skills, and self-reliance. Advanced riders pursue both steep technical descents and high incline climbs. In the case of freeride, downhill, and dirt jumping, aerial maneuvers are performed off both natural features and specially constructed jumps and ramps. Mountain bikers ride on off-road trails such as singletrack , back-country roads, fire roads , and often venture to ski resorts that stay open in the summer for such activities. Because riders are often far from civilization, there is a strong ethic of self-reliance in the sport. Riders learn to repair broken bikes and flat tires to avoid being stranded. Many riders carry a backpack, including water, food, tools for trailside repairs, and a first aid kit in case of injury. Group rides are common, especially on longer treks. Mountain bike orienteering adds the skill of map navigation to mountain biking.

Mountain bikers at Marvin Braude Mulholland Gateway Park 1800s [ edit ] One of the first examples of bicycles modified specifically for off-road use is the expedition of Buffalo Soldiers from Missoula, Montana to Yellowstone in August 1896. [1] The Swiss military had its first bike regiment in 1891. [2] 1900s\u20131960s [ edit ] Bicycles were ridden off-road by road racing cyclists who used cyclocross as a means of keeping fit during the winter. Cyclo-cross eventually became a sport in its own right in the 1940s, with the first world championship taking place in 1950.\nBetween 1951 and 1956, the French Velo Cross Club Parisien (VCCP), comprising about twenty-one young cyclists from the outskirts of Paris where they were born, developed a sport that was remarkably akin to present-day mountain biking. [3] The Rough Stuff Fellowship was established in 1955 by off-road cyclists in the United Kingdom. [4] In Oregon, one Chemeketan club member, D. Gwynn, built a rough terrain trail bicycle in 1966. He named it a \"mountain bicycle\" for its intended place of use. This may be the first use of that name. [5] In England in 1968, Geoff Apps , a motorbike trials rider, began experimenting with off-road bicycle designs. By 1979 he had developed a custom-built lightweight bicycle which was uniquely suited to the wet and muddy off-road conditions found in the south-east of England. They were designed around 2\u00a0inch x 650b Nokian snow tires though a 700x47c (28 in.) version was also produced. These were sold under the Cleland Cycles brand until late 1984. Bikes based on the Cleland design were also sold by English Cycles and Highpath Engineering until the early 1990s. 1970s\u20131980s [ edit ] There were several groups of riders in different areas of the U.S.A. who can make valid claims to playing a part in the birth of the sport. Riders in Crested Butte, Colorado and Cupertino, California tinkered with bikes and adapted them to the rigors of off-road riding. Modified heavy cruiser bicycles , old 1930s and '40s Schwinn bicycles retrofitted with better brakes and fat tires, were used for freewheeling down mountain trails in Marin County , California in the mid-to-late 1970s. At the time, there were no mountain bikes. The earliest ancestors of modern mountain bikes were based around frames from cruiser bicycles such as those made by Schwinn . The Schwinn Excelsior was the frame of choice due to its geometry. Riders used balloon-tired cruisers and modified them with gears and motocross or BMX-style handlebars, creating \"klunkers\". The term would also be used as a verb since the term \"mountain biking\" was not yet in use. Riders would race down mountain fireroads, causing the hub brake to burn the grease inside, requiring the riders to repack the bearings. These were called \"Repack Races\" and triggered the first innovations in mountain bike technology as well as the initial interest of the public (on Mt. Tamalpais in Marin CA, there is still a trail titled \"Repack\"- in reference to these early competitions). The sport originated in California on Marin County 's Mount Tamalpais . [6] It was not until the late 1970s and early 1980s that road bicycle companies started to manufacture mountain bicycles using high-tech lightweight materials. Joe Breeze is normally credited with introducing the first purpose-built mountain bike in 1978. Tom Ritchey then went on to make frames for a company called MountainBikes, a partnership between Gary Fisher , Charlie Kelly , John Frey (Marin County mountain biking innovator) and Tom Ritchey . Tom Ritchey, a welder with skills in frame building, also built the original bikes. The company's three partners eventually dissolved their partnership, and the company became Fisher Mountain Bikes, while Tom Ritchey started his own frame shop. The first mountain bikes were basically road bicycle frames (with heavier tubing and different geometry) with a wider frame and fork to allow for a wider tire. The handlebars were also different in that they were a straight, transverse-mounted handlebar, rather than the dropped, curved handlebars that are typically installed on road racing bicycles. Also, some of the parts on early production mountain bicycles were taken from the BMX bicycle. Other contributors were Otis Guy and Keith Bontrager . Tom Ritchey built the first regularly available mountain bike frame, which was accessorized by Gary Fisher and Charlie Kelly and sold by their company called MountainBikes (later changed to Fisher Mountain Bikes then bought by Trek , still under the name Gary Fisher, currently sold as Trek's \"Gary Fisher Collection\"). The first two mass-produced mountain bikes were sold in the early 1980s: the Specialized Stumpjumper and Univega Alpina Pro. In 1988 The Great Mountain Biking Video was released, soon followed by others. In 2007 Klunkerz: A Film About Mountain Bikes was released, documenting mountain bike history during the formative period in Northern California. Additionally, a group of mountain bikers called the Laguna Rads formed a club during the mid eighties and began a weekly ride, exploring the uncharted coastal hillsides of Laguna Beach, Ca. Industry insiders suggest that this was the birth of the freeride movement, as they were cycling up and down hills and mountains where no cycling specific trail network prexisted. The Laguna Rads also hold the longest running dowhill race once a year since 1986. At the time, the bicycle industry was not impressed with the mountain bike, which many regarded as a short-term fad. In particular, large manufacturers such as Schwinn and Fuji failed to see the significance of an all-terrain bicycle and the coming boom in 'adventure sports'. Instead, the first mass-produced mountain bikes were pioneered by new companies such as MountainBikes (later, Fisher Mountain Bikes), Ritchey, and Specialized . Specialized was an American startup company that arranged for production of mountain bike frames from factories in Japan and Taiwan. First marketed in 1981, [7] Specialized's mountain bike largely followed Tom Ritchey's frame geometry, but used TiG welding to join the frame tubes instead of fillet-brazing, a process better suited to mass production and which helped to reduce labor and manufacturing cost. [8] The bikes were configured with 15 gears using derailleurs , a triple chainring , and a cogset with five sprockets. 1990s\u20132000s [ edit ] Throughout the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, mountain biking moved from a little-known sport to a mainstream activity. Mountain bikes and mountain bike gear, that was once only available at specialty shops or via mail order, became available at standard bike stores. By the mid-first decade of the 21st century, even some department stores began selling inexpensive mountain bikes with full-suspension and disc brakes. In the first decade of the 21st century, trends in mountain bikes included the \"all-mountain bike\", the 29er and the singlespeed . \"All-mountain bikes\" were designed to descend and handle well in rough conditions, but still pedal efficiently for climbing, and were intended to bridge the gap between cross-country bikes and those built specifically for downhill riding. They are characterized by 4\u20136 inches (100\u2013150 millimetres) of travel. 29er bikes are those using 700c sized rims (as do most road bikes), but wider and suited for tires of two inches (50mm) width or more; the increased diameter wheel is able to roll over obstacles better and offers a greater tire contact patch , but also results in a longer wheelbase, making the bike less agile, and in less travel space for the suspension. The single-speed is considered a return to simplicity with no drivetrain components or shifters but thus requires a stronger rider. Following the growing trend in 29-inch bikes (29ers as stated above), there have been other trends in the mountain biking community involving tire size. One of the more prevalent is the new, somewhat esoteric and exotic 650B (27.5\u00a0inch) wheelsize, based on the obscure wheel size for touring road bikes. Another interesting trend in mountain bikes is outfitting dirt jump or urban bikes with rigid forks. These bikes normally use 4\u20135\" travel suspension forks. The resulting product is used for the same purposes as the original bike. A commonly cited reason for making the change to a rigid fork is the enhancement of the rider's ability to transmit force to the ground, which is important for performing tricks. In the mid-first decade of the 21st century, an increasing number of mountain bike-oriented resorts opened. Often, they are similar to or in the same complex as a ski resort or they retrofit the concrete steps and platforms of an abandoned factory as an obstacle course, as with Ray's MTB Indoor Park . Mountain bike parks which are operated as summer season activities at ski hills usually include chairlifts which are adapted to bikes, a number of trails of varying difficulty, and bicycle rental facilities. Equipment [ edit ] Bike [ edit ] A hardtail mountain bike A dual-suspension, 'all-mountain' mountain bike Typical more stout all-mountain bike on rough terrain Main article: Mountain bike Mountain bikes differ from other bikes primarily in that they incorporate features aimed at increasing durability and improving performance in rough terrain. Most modern mountain bikes have some kind of suspension , 26, 27.5 or 29 inch diameter tires, usually between 1.7 and 2.5\u00a0inches in width, and a wider, flat or upwardly-rising handlebar that allows a more upright riding position, giving the rider more control. They have a smaller, reinforced frame , usually made of wide tubing. Tires usually have a pronounced tread , and are mounted on rims which are stronger than those used on most non-mountain bicycles. Compared to other bikes, mountain bikes also tend to more frequently use hydraulic disc brakes . They also tend to have lower ratio gears to facilitate climbing steep hills and traversing obstacles. Pedals vary from simple platform pedals, where the rider simply places the shoes on top of the pedals, to clipless , where the rider uses a specially equipped shoe with a cleat that engages mechanically into the pedal. Accessories [ edit ] Glasses with little or no difference from those used in other cycling sports, help protect against debris while on the trail. Filtered lenses, whether yellow for cloudy days or shaded for sunny days, protect the eyes from strain. Downhill and freeride mountain bikers often use goggles similar to motocross or snowboard goggles in unison with their full face helmets. Shoes generally have gripping soles similar to those of hiking boots for scrambling over un-ridable obstacles, unlike the smooth-bottomed shoes used in road cycling. The shank of mountain bike shoes is generally more flexible than road cycling shoes. Shoes compatible with clipless pedal systems are also frequently used. Clothing is chosen for comfort during physical exertion in the backcountry, and its ability to withstand falls. Road touring clothes are often inappropriate due to their delicate fabrics and construction. Depending on the type of mountain biking, different types of clothes and styles are commonly worn. Cross-country mountain bikers tend to wear lycra shorts and tight road style jerseys due to the need for comfort and efficiency. Downhill riders tend to wear heavier fabric baggy shorts or moto-cross style trousers in order to protect themselves from falls. All mountain/enduro riders tend to wear light fabric baggy shorts and jerseys as they can be in the saddle for long periods of time. Hydration systems are important for mountain bikers in the backcountry, ranging from simple water bottles to water bags with drinking tubes in lightweight backpacks (e.g., Camelbaks) . GPS systems are sometimes added to the handlebars and are used to monitor progress on trails. Pump to inflate tires. CO2 Inflator with Cartridge to inflate a tubeless tire . Bike tools and extra bike tubes are important, as mountain bikers frequently find themselves miles from help, with flat tires or other mechanical problems that must be handled by the rider. High-power lights based on LED technology, especially for mountain biking at night. Protective gear [ edit ] This section is written like a manual or guidebook . Please help rewrite this section from a descriptive, neutral point of view , and remove advice or instruction. (February 2016) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) Play media Mountain bikers in the Port Hills , New Zealand, wearing a variety of protective gear The level of protection worn by individual riders varies greatly and is affected by speed, trail conditions, the weather, experience, fitness, desired style and numerous other factors, including personal choice. Protection becomes more important where these factors may be considered to increase the possibility or severity of a crash. A helmet and gloves are usually regarded as sufficient for the majority of non-technical riding. Full-face helmets, goggles and armored suits or jackets are frequently used in downhill mountain biking, where the extra bulk and weight may help mitigate the risks of bigger and more frequent crashes. [9] Helmets provide important head protection. The use of helmets, in one form or another, is almost universal amongst all mountain bikers. The main three types are cross-country, rounded skateboarder style (nicknamed \"half shells\" or \"skate style\") and full-face. Cross-country helmets tend to be light and well ventilated, and more comfortable to wear for long periods, especially while perspiring in hot weather. In XC competitions, most bikers use the usual road-racing style helmets, for their lightweight and aerodynamic qualities. Skateboard helmets are simpler and cheaper than other helmet types; provide greater coverage of the head and resist minor scrapes and knocks. Unlike road-biking helmets, skateboard helmets typically have a thicker, hard plastic shell which can take multiple impact before it needs to be replaced. The trade-off for this is that they tend to be much heavier and less ventilated (sweatier), therefore not suitable for endurance-based riding. Full-face helmets (BMX-style) provide the highest level of protection, being stronger again than skateboard style and including a jaw guard to protect the face. The weight is the main issue with this type, but today they are often reasonably well-ventilated and made of lightweight materials such as carbon fiber.  (Full-face helmets with detachable chin-guards are available in some locations, but there are compromises to keep in mind with these designs.)  As all helmets should meet minimum standards, SNELL B.95 (American Standard) BS EN 1078:1997 (European Standard), DOT or \"motorized ratings\" are making their way into the market. The choice of helmet often comes down to rider preference, likelihood of crashing, and on what features or properties of a helmet they place emphasis. Helmets are mandatory at competitive events and almost without exception at bike parks, most organisations also stipulate when and where full-face helmets must be used. Body armor and pads , often referred to simply as \"armor\", protect limbs and trunk in the event of a crash. While initially made for and marketed at downhillers, freeriders and jump/street riders, body armor has trickled into other areas of mountain biking as trails have become steeper and more technically complex (hence bringing a commensurately higher injury risk). Armor ranges from simple neoprene sleeves for knees and elbows to complex, articulated combinations of hard plastic shells and padding that cover a whole limb or the entire body. Some companies market body armor jackets and even full-body suits designed to provide greater protection through greater coverage of the body and more secure pad retention. Most upper-body protectors also include a spine protector that comprises plastic or metal reinforced plastic plates, over foam padding, which are joined together so that they articulate and move with the back. Some mountain bikers also use BMX-style body armor, such as chest plates, abdomen protectors, and spine plates. New technology has seen an influx of integrated neck protectors that fit securely with full-face helmets, such as the Leatt-Brace . There is a general correlation between increased protection and increased weight/decreased mobility, although different styles balance these factors differently. Different levels of protection are deemed necessary/desirable by different riders in different circumstances. Backpack hydration systems such as Camelbaks , where a water-filled bladder is held close to the spine, are used by some riders for their perceived protective value. More recently, with the increase in enduro racing, backpack hydration systems are also being sold with inbuilt spine protection. However, there is only anecdotal evidence of protection. Gloves can offer increased comfort while riding, by alleviating compression and friction, and can protect against superficial hand injuries. [10] They provide protection in the event of strikes to the back or palm of the hand or when putting the hand out in a fall and can protect the hand, fingers, and knuckles from abrasion on rough surfaces. Many different styles of gloves exist, with various fits, sizes, finger lengths, palm padding and armor options available. Armoring knuckles and the backs of hands with plastic panels is common in more extreme types of mountain biking. First aid kits are often carried by mountain bikers, so that they are able to clean and dress cuts and abrasions and splint broken limbs. Head, brain, and spinal injuries become more likely as speeds increase. All of these can bring permanent changes in quality of life. Experienced mountain bike guides may be trained in dealing with suspected spinal injuries (e.g., immobilizing the victim and keeping the neck straight). Seriously injured people may need to be removed by stretcher , by a motor vehicle suitable for the terrain, or by helicopter. Protective gear cannot provide immunity against injuries. For example, concussions can still occur despite the use of helmets, and spinal injuries can still occur with the use of spinal padding and neck braces. [11] [12] The use of high-tech protective gear can result in a revenge effect, whereupon some cyclists feel safe taking dangerous risks. [13] Because the key determinant of injury risk is kinetic energy , and because kinetic energy increases with the square of speed, effectively each doubling of speed quadruples the injury risk. Higher speeds of travel also add danger due to reaction time . Because higher speeds mean that the rider travels further during his/her reaction time, this leaves less travel distance within which to react safely. [14] This, in turn, further multiplies the risk of an injurious crash. Types [ edit ] Cross-country cycling [ edit ] Main article: Cross-country cycling Cross-Country (XC) generally means riding point-to-point or in a loop including climbs and descents on a variety of terrain. A typical XC bike weighs around 9-13 kilos (20-30\u00a0lbs), and has 0\u2013125 millimeters (0.0\u20134.9 inches) of suspension travel front and sometimes rear. All-mountain/Enduro [ edit ] Main article: Enduro (mountain biking) All-mountain/Enduro uses bikes with a moderate-travel suspension systems and components that are usually stronger than XC models, but a weight still suitable for climbing and descending. While traditionally called All-mountain riding, this style has been adopted to the Enduro World Series. There are two formats of Enduro racing. \"Big-Mountain\" Enduro is similar to a DH course, but is much longer, sometimes taking a full day to complete and often incorporates climbing sections. \"Gravity\" enduro uses roughly equal amounts uphill and downhill, but the uphill segments are not timed. Typically, there is a maximum time limit on how long a rider has to reach the top of the climb. There is also a third category called \"super-D\" which is similar to XC, but has sustained climbs followed by sustained descents, with the climbs less technical than the descents. Enduro racing is seen as the \"everyman's\" race in North America, and while there are still extremely high level riders such as J\u00e9r\u00f4me Cl\u00e9mentz that race enduro full-time, most enduro racers compete for fun. Downhill [ edit ] Main article: Downhill mountain biking Downhill mountain biking Downhill (DH) is, in the most general sense, riding mountain bikes downhill. Courses include large jumps (up to and including 12 meters (39 feet)), drops of 3+ meters (10+ feet), and are generally rough and steep from top to bottom. The rider commonly travels to the point of descent by other means than cycling, such as a ski lift or automobile, as the weight of the downhill mountain bike often precludes any serious climbing. Downhill racers must possess a unique combination of total body strength, aerobic and anaerobic fitness, mental control, as well as the acceptance of a relatively high risk of incurring serious injury. Because of their extremely steep terrain (often located in summer at ski resorts), downhill is one of the most extreme and dangerous cycling disciplines. Minimum body protection in a true downhill setting entails wearing knee pads and a full-face helmet with goggles, albeit riders and racers commonly wear full-body suits that include padding at various locations. Downhill-specific bikes are universally equipped with front and rear suspension, large disc brakes, and use heavier frame tubing than other mountain bikes. Downhill bicycles now weigh around 16\u201320\u00a0kg (35\u201344\u00a0lb), while the most expensive professional downhill mountain bikes can weigh as little as 15 kilograms (33 pounds), fully equipped with custom carbon fiber parts, air suspension, tubeless tires and more. Downhill frames have anywhere from 170\u2013250 millimeters (6.7\u20139.8 inches) of travel and are usually equipped with a 200 millimeters (7.9 inches) travel dual-crown fork. Four-cross/Dual Slalom [ edit ] Main article: Four-cross Four-cross/Dual Slalom (4X) is a discipline in which riders compete either on separate tracks, as in Dual Slalom, or on a short slalom track, as in 4X. Most bikes used are light hard-tails, although the last World Cup was actually won on a full suspension bike. The tracks have dirt jumps, berms, and gaps. Professionals in gravity mountain biking tend to concentrate either on downhill mountain biking or 4X/dual slalom because they are very different. However, some riders, such as Cedric Gracia , still do 4X and DH, although that is becoming more rare as 4X takes on its own identity. Freeride [ edit ] Main article: Freeride Freeride Freeride / Big Hit / Hucking, as the name suggests, is a 'do anything' discipline that encompasses everything from downhill racing without the clock to jumping, riding 'North Shore' style (elevated trails made of interconnecting bridges and logs), and generally riding trails and/or stunts that require more skill and aggressive techniques than XC. \"Slopestyle\" type riding is an increasingly popular genre that combines big-air, stunt-ridden freeride with BMX style tricks. Slopestyle courses are usually constructed at already established mountain bike parks and include jumps, large drops, quarter-pipes, and other wooden obstacles. There are always multiple lines through a course and riders compete for judges' points by choosing lines that highlight their particular skills. A \"typical\" freeride bike is hard to define, but typical specifications are 13-18 kilos (30-40\u00a0lbs) with 150\u2013250 millimeters (5.9\u20139.8 inches) of suspension front and rear. Freeride bikes are generally heavier and more amply suspended than their XC counterparts, but usually retain much of their climbing ability. It is up to the rider to build his or her bike to lean more toward a preferred level of aggressiveness. Dirt Jumping [ edit ] Main article: Dirt jumping Dirt Jumping (DJ) is the practice of riding bikes over shaped mounds of dirt or soil and becoming airborne. The goal is that after riding over the 'take off' the rider will become airborne, and aim to land on the 'landing'. Dirt jumping can be done on almost any bicycle, but the bikes chosen are generally smaller and more maneuverable hardtails so that tricks e.g. backflips, are easier to complete. The bikes are simpler so that when a crash occurs there are fewer components to break or cause the rider injury. Bikes are typically built from sturdier materials such as steel to handle repeated heavy impacts of crashes and bails. Trials [ edit ] Main article: Mountain bike trials Trials riding consists of hopping and jumping bikes over obstacles, without touching a foot onto the ground. It can be performed either off-road or in an urban environment. This requires an excellent sense of balance. The emphasis is placed on techniques of effectively overcoming the obstacles, although street-trials (as opposed to competition-oriented trials) is much like Street and DJ, where doing tricks with style is the essence. Trials bikes look almost nothing like mountain bikes. They use either 20\", 24\" or 26\" wheels and have very small, low frames, some types without a saddle. Urban/Street [ edit ] Main article: Freestyle BMX Urban/Street is essentially the same as urban BMX (or Freestyle BMX), in which riders perform tricks by riding on/over man made objects. The bikes are the same as those used for Dirt Jumping, having 24\" or 26\" wheels. Also, they are very light, many in the range of 25\u201330\u00a0lb (11\u201314\u00a0kg), and are typically hardtails with between 0-100 millimeters of front suspension. As with Dirt Jumping and Trials, style and execution are emphasized. Mountain bike trail riding (trail biking) Trail riding [ edit ] Main article: Trail riding: Mountain bike trails Trail riding or trail biking is recreational mountain biking on recognised, and often waymarked, trails ; unpaved tracks, forest paths, etc. Trails may take the form of single routes or part of a larger complexes, known as trail centres. There are \"trail bike\" designs for this activity. Marathon [ edit ] Mountain Bike Touring or Marathon is long-distance touring on dirt roads and single track with a mountain bike. With the popularity of the Great Divide Trail , the Colorado Trail and other long-distance off-road biking trails, specially outfitted mountain bikes are increasingly being used for touring. Bike manufacturers like Salsa have even developed MTB touring bikes like the Fargo model. Mixed Terrain Cycle-Touring or rough riding is a form of mountain-bike touring but involves cycling over a variety of surfaces and topography on a single route, with a single bicycle that is expected to be satisfactory for all segments. The recent surge in popularity of mixed-terrain touring is in part a reaction against the increasing specialization of the bicycle industry. Mixed-terrain bicycle travel has a storied history of focusing on efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and freedom of travel over varied surfaces. [15] Bikepacking [ edit ] Bikepacking is a self-supported style of lightly-loaded single or multiple night mountain biking. [16] Bikepacking is similar to bike touring, however the two sports generally use different bikes and the main difference is the method of carrying gear. Bikepacking generally involves carrying less gear and using smaller frame bags while bike touring will use panniers . [17] A typical bikepacking set-up includes a frame bag, handlebar roll, seat pack and backpack and typical gear includes lightweight and basic camping gear, and a bike repair kit. [18] Mountain bikes are generally used as many bike packing destinations are reached via forest-service roads or singletrack trails. [16] Mountain bikes specific to bike-packing use a slightly taller frame to get the maximum framebag capacity. This is achieved by using a longer headtube, a more horizontal top tube and a reduced stem degree. [19] Generally, bikepackers tend to cover anywhere from 25 to 75 miles (40 \u2013 120\u00a0km) in a given day as the riding can be  technical. [20] Risks [ edit ] Injuries are a given factor when mountain biking, especially in the more extreme disciplines such as downhill biking. Injuries range from minor wounds, such as cuts and abrasions from falls on gravel or other surfaces, to major injuries such as broken bones, head or spinal injuries resulting from impacts with rocks, trees or the terrain being ridden on. [21] [22] Protective equipment can protect against minor injuries and reduce the extent or seriousness of major impacts, but may not protect a rider from major impacts or accidents. To reduce the risk of injury, a rider must also take steps to minimize the risk of accidents, and thus the potential for injury; by choosing trails which fall within the range of their experience level, ensuring that they are fit enough to deal with the trail they have chosen, and keeping their bike in top mechanical condition. If a mountain biker wishes to explore more dangerous trails or disciplines, such as downhill riding, they must learn new skills, such as jumping and avoiding obstacles. Where a rider lacks the fitness required to ride a particular class of trail, they may become fatigued, putting themselves at an increased risk of having an accident. Lastly, maintenance of the rider's bike needs to be carried out more frequently for mountain biking than for casual commuter biking . Mountain biking places higher demands on every part of the bike. Jumps and impacts can crack the frame or damage components or the tire rims, and steep, fast descents can quickly wear out brake pads. Thus, whereas a casual rider may only check over and maintain their bike every few months,a mountain biker should check and properly maintain the bike before and after every ride. Advocacy organizations [ edit ] Mountain bikers have faced land access issues from the beginnings of the sport. Some areas where the first mountain bikers have ridden have faced extreme restrictions or elimination of riding. Opposition to the sport has led to the development of local, regional, and international mountain bike groups. The different groups that formed generally work to create new trails, maintain existing trails, and help existing trails that may have issues. Groups work with private and public entities from the individual landowner to city parks departments, on up through the state level at the DNR, and into the federal level. Different groups will work individually or together to achieve results. Advocacy organizations work through numerous methods such as education, trail work days, and trail patrols. Examples of the education an advocacy group can provide include: Educate local bicycle riders, property managers, and other user groups on the proper development of trails, and on the International Mountain Bicycling Association 's (IMBA), \"Rules of the Trail.\" Examples of trail work days can include: Flagging, cutting, and signing a new trail, or removing downed trees after a storm. A trail patrol is a bike rider who has had some training to help assist other (including non-cyclists) trail users. The IMBA is a non-profit advocacy group whose mission is to create, enhance and preserve trail opportunities for mountain bikers worldwide. IMBA serves as an umbrella organization for mountain biking advocacy worldwide, and represents more than 700 affiliated mountain biking groups. The group was originally formed to fight widespread trail closures. In 1988, five California mountain bike clubs linked to form IMBA. The founding clubs were: Concerned Off Road Bicyclists Association, Bicycle Trails Council East Bay, Bicycle Trails Council Marin, Sacramento Rough Riders, and Responsible Organized Mountain. Environmental impact [ edit ] According to a review published by the International Mountain Bicycling Association, the environmental impact of mountain biking, as a relatively new sport, is poorly understood. The review notes that \"as with all recreational pursuits, it is clear that mountain biking contributes some degree of environmental degradation\". [23] Mountain biking can result in both soil and vegetation damage, which can be caused by skidding, but also by the construction of unauthorised features such as jumps and bridges, and trails themselves. [24] Several studies have reported that a mountain bike's impact on a given length of trail surface is comparable to that of a hiker, and substantially less than that of an equestrian or motorized off-road vehicle. [25] [26] [27] [28] [ unreliable source? ] A critical literature review by Jason Lathrop on the ecological impact of mountain biking notes that while recreational trail use in general is well studied, few studies explore the specific impact of mountain biking. He quotes the Bureau of Land Management : \"An estimated 13.5 million mountain bicyclists visit public lands each year to enjoy the variety of trails. What was once a low use activity that was easy to manage has become more complex\". [29] The environmental impacts of mountain biking can be greatly reduced by not riding on wet or sensitive trails, keeping speeds modest so as to minimize cornering forces and braking forces, not skidding, and by staying on the trail.

{"question": "how much canadian tire money do you get", "answer": "", "context": "Canadian Tire money - Wikipedia Canadian Tire money From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search Canadian Tire money argent Canadian Tire (in French) 10\u00a2 and $1 Canadian Tire money Denominations Symbol $ Banknotes 5\u00a2, 10\u00a2, 25\u00a2, 50\u00a2, $1 & $2 Coins $1 Demographics User(s) Canadian Tire , and other businesses in Canada Issuance Central bank Canadian Tire Printer Canadian Bank Note Company & British American Banknote Company. Mint Royal Canadian Mint (coin only) Canadian Tire money , officially Canadian Tire 'money' , [1] (CTM) is a loyalty program operated by the Canadian retail chain Canadian Tire . It consists of coupons, issued by the company, which resembles real banknotes . It can be used as scrip in Canadian Tire stores, but is not considered a private currency . The notes are printed on paper similar to what Canadian currency was printed on when they were printed on real paper, and were jointly produced by two of the country\u2019s long-established security printers, British American Banknote Company (BABN) and Canadian Bank Note Company (CBN). [2] Some privately owned businesses in Canada accept CTM as payment (see history below), since the owners of many such businesses shop at Canadian Tire. In Canadian Tire stores, CTM is accepted for Canadian money at par. Contents [ hide ] 1 History and dynamics 2 Denominations 3 Usage beyond Canadian Tire 4 Special Issuances 5 See also 6 References 7 External links History and dynamics [ edit ] A recognizable facet of CTM is the man featured on the face of each bill. According to Canadian Tire representatives, the fictional character represented is referred to as \"Sandy McTire\" and sports a tam o' shanter and a stylized waxed moustache. He is based on no specific individual but is assumed to represent a thrifty Scotsman, the 1950s everyman of blue-collar Canada. It was introduced in 1958, and was inspired by Muriel Billes, the wife of Canadian Tire's co-founder and first president, Alfred J. Billes , as a response to the promotional giveaways that many gas companies offered at the time. It was only available at Canadian Tire gas bars but was so successful that, in 1961, it was extended to the retail stores as well, and has become the most successful loyalty program in Canadian retail history. [2] The print on the 'notes' refers to them as \"cash bonus coupons\". Canadian Tire Money is given out for purchases paid for by cash or debit, based on the pre-tax total, excluding labour and shop supplies costs. The initial coupon rate earned was 5% of the eligible purchase price, but it was lowered to 3%, then to 1.4%, and now is 0.4%. [3] Customers can use Canadian Tire Money to buy anything in the store. (Older coupons state that they are redeemable at Canadian Tire stores and gas stations ; however, coupons produced during at least the last 15 years lack this wording and are therefore redeemable in the stores only.) It can also be used to cover the sales tax on the purchases, since it is accepted as cash after the taxes are calculated. Also, even if a purchase was made entirely in these coupons, it is also considered as a cash purchase and more coupons will be calculated and paid out. In Ontario , the Retail Sales Tax law and Bulletins state that the \"coupon must be reimbursed by the franchisee\". By submitting them to other merchants, the merchants were in essence breaking Ontario law when they failed to include the discount in the value of the goods being calculated for being taxed. Some merchants were accepting Canadian Tire Money as a discount, but then were not calculating and remitting the sales taxes, as required by law, and then were getting fined for the practice; this is an ongoing issue. In 2012, Canadian Tire began a pilot program to make its money \"plastic\", to make it into a more manageable and trackable loyalty program. [4] The new plastic loyalty card can earn points at more than twice the rate of the traditional paper money. According to customer service in July 2017 the rate on purchases made with the Canadian Tire \"Options\" card on in-store products is 4%. The reward rate for purchases at other stores is 0.8%. Denominations [ edit ] In 1958, five different denominations (composed of 5-cents, 10-cents, 25-cents, 50-cents, and $1) were issued. The revision of 1962 included the introduction of four lower values (1 to 4 cents), and 12 higher denominations, including 35 and 60 cents. A sequence of six denominations was introduced in 1985 including the 3-cents, 5-cents, 10-cents, 25-cents, 40-cents, 50-cents, and $1. A $2 note was added in 1989, and the 3 cents was dropped in 1991. [5] CTM coupons are now produced in 5-cent, 10-cent, 25-cent, 50-cent, one-dollar, and two-dollar denominations. In addition, Canadian Tire Money can be earned electronically on Canadian Tire credit cards such as the Canadian Tire Options MasterCard . The latter can be used wherever MasterCard is accepted and earns Canadian Tire Money no matter where it is used to make a purchase, anywhere in the world. CTM is treated as real currency by the franchise and cannot be directly exchanged for real Canadian currency for customers. If an item bought with Canadian Tire Money is returned the customer receives either Canadian Tire Money back or is given the amount on a gift card. If an item is bought with cash or card and is returned for a refund the customer receives the refund less the value of the CTM issued on the item unless the CTM is also returned. On December 2, 2009, as part of an advertised deal, Canadian Tire had handed out the first Canadian Tire coin, redeemable with the purchase of at least $40 of merchandise. Another similar deal followed in 2010 (coinciding with the 2010 Olympic Winter Games ), with a three coin winter collection. The coins can be spent in the same manner as conventional CTM. Usage beyond Canadian Tire [ edit ] In late 2004 in Moncton , New Brunswick , several customers at a Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ATM were dispensed a total of 11 bills of Canadian Tire money instead of real bills. They were compensated by the bank. [6] Culturally, Canadian Tire money is sometimes referred to by comedians: perhaps as a national version of \"Monopoly money\", perhaps invoking a pejorative comparison of the value of Canadian dollars against U.S. dollars, or perhaps as a misunderstood exotic element of Canadian society (cf. Ron James' comedic reference to the person depicted on the bill as \"our king\"). In the 2009 Trailer Park Boys movie Countdown to Liquor Day , Jim Lahey offers Julian $700 in Canadian Tire money for his trailer. In the mid-1990s, a man in Germany was caught with up to $11 million in counterfeit Canadian Tire money. It was recovered before he left for Canada to redeem it. An Armenian man from Georgia also had similar ideas about counterfeit scrip, and was caught with over 45 million in counterfeit coupons. [7] Special Issuances [ edit ] Specially-issued 10-cent denomination of Canadian Tire currency (an in-store coupon). A 10 cent note was released by the company between June 30th and July 2nd, 2017 to celebrate the 150th birthday of the Confederation of Canada in 1867 as part of national festivities.

Justin Timberlake was the featured performer, as confirmed by the National Football League (NFL) on October 22, 2017. [1] It was televised nationally by NBC . Contents [ hide ] 1 Synopsis 2 Background 3 Development 4 Critical response 5 Commercial reception 6 Setlist 7 See also 8 References 9 External links Synopsis [ edit ] Timberlake with dancers during the halftime performance Timberlake during halftime show Timberlake performing \"Suit & Tie\" with the University of Minnesota Marching Band The show began with Jimmy Fallon introducing Justin Timberlake , followed by a video screen depicting Timberlake performing \" Filthy \" in a club setting below the field level of the stadium. He then walked up a staircase and appeared on a ramp stage extending outward into the field, descending into a series of stages surrounded by a crowd. Timberlake proceeded to move through the crowd performing \" Rock Your Body \" with a troupe of female backup dancers, abruptly stopping short of the end of the song and shifting to \" Se\u00f1orita \" on a small stage with his backing dancers. Upon reaching the main stage, he performed a number of songs, including \" SexyBack \", \" My Love \", and \" Cry Me a River \", which featured a dance break mid-field. Upon reaching the next stage, Timberlake performed his hit song \" Suit & Tie \" as the University of Minnesota Marching Band , wearing black tuxedos, played backup instrumentals and marched out to meet him. [2] The Stadium and the city of Minneapolis were shown to be lit purple during Timberlake's tribute to Prince Dancers fill the field during Timberlake's performance of \"Can't Stop the Feeling!\" Timberlake proceeded to walk up to a white grand piano while performing \" Until the End of Time \", then segued into \" I Would Die 4 U \" as a tribute to Minneapolis-native Prince . A video of Prince performing the song played in the background, projected onto on a large multi-story sheet. An aerial shot showed downtown Minneapolis covered in purple lighting that morphed into Prince's trademark Love Symbol , with the stadium at the center. He then returned to the main stage to perform \" Mirrors \", as hundreds of dancers and members of the marching band performed choreography with large mirrors, creating bright reflections in the broadcast and across the roof of the stadium. Timberlake closed the show with \" Can't Stop the Feeling! \", entering the stands at the conclusion of the song. [3] [4] For the first time since the Super Bowl XLVI halftime show in Indianapolis in 2012, no pyrotechnics were used throughout the performance. The show relied mostly on lasers and video screens for visual effects. [5] Background [ edit ] Field being set up for Timberlake's performance In July 2017, multiple media outlets reported that Britney Spears was in talks to perform at Halftime, but Pepsi quickly denied it a few days later. During August and September 2017, several publications informed that Timberlake was the frontrunner to performer at the Super Bowl LII halftime, first along with his frequent-collaborator Jay-Z as co-headliner, and then as the solo performer. [6] A spokesperson from the NFL stated at the time, \"along with Pepsi, we know that we will put on a spectacular show. When it is time to announce her name we will do it. Or his name. Or their names.\" [7] The NFL confirmed the announcement on October 22 with a video starring Timberlake and Jimmy Fallon . [8] This was Timberlake's third appearance in a Super Bowl halftime show. As a member of NSYNC , Timberlake appeared in the Super Bowl XXXV (2001) halftime show, and as a guest artist in the Super Bowl XXXVIII (2004), which performance featured a controversial incident where Timberlake accidentally exposed one of Janet Jackson 's breasts on national television, described as a wardrobe malfunction . The Parents Television Council penned an open letter to Timberlake asking to keep the performance \" family-friendly .\" While the organization acknowledged that Timberlake apologized for the 2004 incident, they asked him to stay true to his word, saying \"we are heartened by your response that the events of 2004 are not going to happen in 2018,\" as the singer stated in a prior interview that \"we are not going to do that again.\" [9] In an interview with Billboard , Pepsi executives expressed: We are all big fans of Justin Timberlake. We\u2019ve kind of felt that Justin deserves, and has for a number of years, to be the main artist for the halftime show because previously he wasn\u2019t the main artist. It was just about the timing. To be honest, we have discussed Justin for the last number of years for coming and doing halftime, and this year just felt really right to us. He is hands down one of the greatest entertainers currently alive, it was a no-brainer. We know he\u2019s gonna bring it. [10] The Halftime Show included a remembrance for Indianapolis Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson , who died just hours before Super Bowl LII after being struck by a vehicle. Development [ edit ] The U.S. Bank Stadium , where Super Bowl and the halftime show was held. During the performance, Timberlake wore an outfit designed by Stella McCartney , which consists of \"alter nappa fringed jacket with a shirt, featuring a landscape artwork by British artist Martin Ridley ,\" according to a press release. Also part of the look is a Prince of Wales-check and camouflage splatter-print suit and matching jacket. As usual for McCartney, these pieces were made from animal-free leather and organic cotton. [11] [12] Timberlake stated in a press conference that there would be no guest musicians in the halftime show and that the event would focus solely on himself and his backing band, the Tennessee Kids. [13] Regarding the Prince tribute, the performance's creative visual lead, Fireplay's Nick Whitehouse, told Rolling Stone : Paying tribute to Prince was something JT highlighted as an important moment for this show, and we spent quite a bit of time ensuring this moment would be true to his legacy. Ultimately, Justin decided that the only person who could do Prince justice is Prince. The band held 50-hours worth of rehearsals in preparation for the show. [14] Prince had previously stated he did not want to be included in new music after death in a 1998 interview, citing The Beatles ' \" Free as a Bird \" as an example of a practice he considered to be \"demonic.\" His family granted permission to use Prince's likeness on the condition that it not be used in a hologram , and they approved of the final result. [15] [2] Sheila E , a former bandmate of Prince's who was involved in negotiations over the use of his likeness, stated that \"a bigger company\" (she declined to specify whether it was Pepsi or the NFL) had insisted on including the Prince apparition and that the notion was not originally Timberlake's idea. [16] Despite the lack of an individual guest artist, the more than 300-member University of Minnesota Marching Band was featured in the show. The band's drumline, brass, and saxophone sections pre-recorded and performed with Timberlake during his performance of \"Suit & Tie.\" The upper woodwind and auxiliary sections led drill formations and held large mirrors during Timberlake\u2019s performance of his song \"Mirrors\", and acted as fans and dancers throughout other portions of the show, including the club scene at the show's opening. All members of the band were featured on the field in the show's finale, \"Can't Stop the Feeling!\". The band had previously performed in the halftime show of Super Bowl XXVI . [4] Critical response [ edit ] Timberlake\u2019s performance received mixed reviews. [17] In a positive review, Bruce R. Miller of Sioux City Journal wrote \"Timberlake is a masterful live performer \u2013 which made Sunday's Super Bowl performance about the only sure bet,\" he continued commenting the performer \"did a lot of infectious dancing and managed to play with the crowd like no other.\" Although it did not have a moment that \"stuck,\" he considered the Prince tribute the best moment of the show. [18] In a similarly positive review, Taylor Weatherby of Billboard said \"there is no denying that Timberlake absolutely rocked his first headlining [halftime]\", further adding \"Timberlake's halftime show was undeniably mesmerizing. From starting in the concourse to making his way into the crowd (and making #SelfieKid an instant superstar) for the ending.\" She also considered it \"is made for a TV experience\" rather than for the public in the stadium, mainly for the sound quality difficulties, but also criticized him for including Rock Your Body in the set list. [19] From the same magazine, Nina Braca wrote \"his moves were on point,\" [17] and Andrew Ubterberger said two things were \"relatively certain\" about the performance. \"most of America would love it, and most of the Internet would hate it,\" and added Timberlake was \"in a situation that was both a can't-lose and a can't-win. It would've been virtually impossible for him to please the critics he'd alienated over the last couple years.\" [20] Also from Billboard, Andrew Unterberge wrote, \"Timberlake's audio was somewhat lacking throughout...but the choreography, live-band energy and song selection were all pretty impeccable\". [21] Chris Willman of Variety stated that, \"Timberlake turned in a more enjoyably physical performance than just about anybody else who's done the Bowl show\u2026 and if it was more a feat of athleticism than aestheticism, you can\u2019t say that\u2019s entirely inappropriate for the occasion.\" [22] Willman also wrote that the show, \"wasn't one for the ages, but was impressive as a show of athleticism\" [22] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times wrote that Timberlake's performance was, \"heavy on dance spectacle, light on vocal authority\". [23] Daniel Fienberg of The Hollywood Reporter called the show, \"energetic, but also entirely lacking in live excitement.\" Feinberg criticized the show for largely lacking spontaneity and live vocals. Feinberg wrote that Timberlake delivered, \"one of the most over-planned, least surprising performances imaginable.\" [24] Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly graded Timberlake's performance a \"C\", calling it, \"dutiful, and empty\". Franich faulted Timberlake for playing too safe with his performance. [25] Similarly, Fran Guan of Vulture.com wrote, \"Technically speaking, Timberlake\u2019s set was a testament to precision\". Guan, however, criticized Timberlake's performance from lacking in personality, and regarded his performance as unmemorable. [26] The Guardian gave Timberlake 3 out of 5 stars, calling his performance forgettable but flashy. [27] In an interview with NPR, Ann Powers said that \"the entire performance was shrouded in the sense of Timberlake not being right for this moment \u2014 and the Janet Jackson controversy haunted it.\" [28] Daniel D\u2019Addarrio of Time.com gave the performance a negative review, criticizing Timberlake for singing Cry Me A River in addition to Rock Your Body, calling the song\u2019s lyrics about an evil promiscuous woman out of step with the national mood, and said that the only message from Timberlake\u2019s performance was that he loves his back catalog [29] Deadline felt \"but you could see the motions more than you felt the music.\" [30] Chris Richards of The Washington Post regarded Timberlake\u2019s performance as, \u201cunambiguously underwhelming\u201d. [31] USA Today and Vulture compared Timberlake's performance unfavorably to Prince's own 2007 halftime show . [32] [26] Amanda Petrusich of The New Yorker wrote that Timberlake\u2019s decision to omit the end of \"Rock Your Body\" (which was performed during the controversial 2004 halftime) felt, \u201cless like an apology than yet more spineless deflection\u201d. [33] However, Andrew Unterberge of Billboard considered Timberlake's decision to cut the song short to be wise. [21] Timberlake's Stella McCartney-designed outfit received negative reviews, with some critics regarding it as \"tacky\". [17] [24] [19] [21] The LA Times also gave a very critical review, one which also stated that Timberlake had nothing to say in his performance, and said that it lacked soul and meaning. [34] The Digital Journal gave him 2/5 stars and called it lackluster. [35] Commercial reception [ edit ] The Super Bowl LII halftime show was seen by 106.6 million television viewers in the United States, 9% less than Lady Gaga's in 2017 . It had higher average viewership than the game itself, and the decline for the halftime show was roughly in line with that of the game as a whole, which had lost 7% compared to the previous year. [36] According to initial sales reports from Nielsen Music , sales of the songs Timberlake performed during the halftime show gained 534% in the United States on February 4, the day of the Super Bowl, compared to Feb. 3, while his streams on Spotify gained 214%.

Justin Timberlake was the featured performer, as confirmed by the National Football League (NFL) on October 22, 2017. [1] It was televised nationally by NBC . Contents [ hide ] 1 Synopsis 2 Background 3 Development 4 Critical response 5 Commercial reception 6 Setlist 7 See also 8 References 9 External links Synopsis [ edit ] Timberlake with dancers during the halftime performance Timberlake during halftime show Timberlake performing \"Suit & Tie\" with the University of Minnesota Marching Band The show began with Jimmy Fallon introducing Justin Timberlake , followed by a video screen depicting Timberlake performing \" Filthy \" in a club setting below the field level of the stadium. He then walked up a staircase and appeared on a ramp stage extending outward into the field, descending into a series of stages surrounded by a crowd. Timberlake proceeded to move through the crowd performing \" Rock Your Body \" with a troupe of female backup dancers, abruptly stopping short of the end of the song and shifting to \" Se\u00f1orita \" on a small stage with his backing dancers. Upon reaching the main stage, he performed a number of songs, including \" SexyBack \", \" My Love \", and \" Cry Me a River \", which featured a dance break mid-field. Upon reaching the next stage, Timberlake performed his hit song \" Suit & Tie \" as the University of Minnesota Marching Band , wearing black tuxedos, played backup instrumentals and marched out to meet him. [2] The Stadium and the city of Minneapolis were shown to be lit purple during Timberlake's tribute to Prince Dancers fill the field during Timberlake's performance of \"Can't Stop the Feeling!\" Timberlake proceeded to walk up to a white grand piano while performing \" Until the End of Time \", then segued into \" I Would Die 4 U \" as a tribute to Minneapolis-native Prince . A video of Prince performing the song played in the background, projected onto on a large multi-story sheet. An aerial shot showed downtown Minneapolis covered in purple lighting that morphed into Prince's trademark Love Symbol , with the stadium at the center. He then returned to the main stage to perform \" Mirrors \", as hundreds of dancers and members of the marching band performed choreography with large mirrors, creating bright reflections in the broadcast and across the roof of the stadium. Timberlake closed the show with \" Can't Stop the Feeling! \", entering the stands at the conclusion of the song. [3] [4] For the first time since the Super Bowl XLVI halftime show in Indianapolis in 2012, no pyrotechnics were used throughout the performance. The show relied mostly on lasers and video screens for visual effects. [5] Background [ edit ] Field being set up for Timberlake's performance In July 2017, multiple media outlets reported that Britney Spears was in talks to perform at Halftime, but Pepsi quickly denied it a few days later. During August and September 2017, several publications informed that Timberlake was the frontrunner to performer at the Super Bowl LII halftime, first along with his frequent-collaborator Jay-Z as co-headliner, and then as the solo performer. [6] A spokesperson from the NFL stated at the time, \"along with Pepsi, we know that we will put on a spectacular show. When it is time to announce her name we will do it. Or his name. Or their names.\" [7] The NFL confirmed the announcement on October 22 with a video starring Timberlake and Jimmy Fallon . [8] This was Timberlake's third appearance in a Super Bowl halftime show. As a member of NSYNC , Timberlake appeared in the Super Bowl XXXV (2001) halftime show, and as a guest artist in the Super Bowl XXXVIII (2004), which performance featured a controversial incident where Timberlake accidentally exposed one of Janet Jackson 's breasts on national television, described as a wardrobe malfunction . The Parents Television Council penned an open letter to Timberlake asking to keep the performance \" family-friendly .\" While the organization acknowledged that Timberlake apologized for the 2004 incident, they asked him to stay true to his word, saying \"we are heartened by your response that the events of 2004 are not going to happen in 2018,\" as the singer stated in a prior interview that \"we are not going to do that again.\" [9] In an interview with Billboard , Pepsi executives expressed: We are all big fans of Justin Timberlake. We\u2019ve kind of felt that Justin deserves, and has for a number of years, to be the main artist for the halftime show because previously he wasn\u2019t the main artist. It was just about the timing. To be honest, we have discussed Justin for the last number of years for coming and doing halftime, and this year just felt really right to us. He is hands down one of the greatest entertainers currently alive, it was a no-brainer. We know he\u2019s gonna bring it. [10] The Halftime Show included a remembrance for Indianapolis Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson , who died just hours before Super Bowl LII after being struck by a vehicle. Development [ edit ] The U.S. Bank Stadium , where Super Bowl and the halftime show was held. During the performance, Timberlake wore an outfit designed by Stella McCartney , which consists of \"alter nappa fringed jacket with a shirt, featuring a landscape artwork by British artist Martin Ridley ,\" according to a press release. Also part of the look is a Prince of Wales-check and camouflage splatter-print suit and matching jacket. As usual for McCartney, these pieces were made from animal-free leather and organic cotton.

Ultimately, Justin decided that the only person who could do Prince justice is Prince. The band held 50-hours worth of rehearsals in preparation for the show. [14] Prince had previously stated he did not want to be included in new music after death in a 1998 interview, citing The Beatles ' \" Free as a Bird \" as an example of a practice he considered to be \"demonic.\" His family granted permission to use Prince's likeness on the condition that it not be used in a hologram , and they approved of the final result. [15] [2] Sheila E , a former bandmate of Prince's who was involved in negotiations over the use of his likeness, stated that \"a bigger company\" (she declined to specify whether it was Pepsi or the NFL) had insisted on including the Prince apparition and that the notion was not originally Timberlake's idea. [16] Despite the lack of an individual guest artist, the more than 300-member University of Minnesota Marching Band was featured in the show. The band's drumline, brass, and saxophone sections pre-recorded and performed with Timberlake during his performance of \"Suit & Tie.\" The upper woodwind and auxiliary sections led drill formations and held large mirrors during Timberlake\u2019s performance of his song \"Mirrors\", and acted as fans and dancers throughout other portions of the show, including the club scene at the show's opening.

{"question": "collection of all types of documents used in the banks and office definition", "answer": "", "context": "Document - Wikipedia Document From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search For other uses, see Document (disambiguation) . This article has an unclear citation style . The references used may be made clearer with a different or consistent style of citation , footnoting , or external linking . (June 2013) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) Several common types of documents: a birth certificate, a legal document (a restraining order), and a bank statement A document is a written, drawn, presented, or memorialized representation of thought . The word originates from the Latin documentum , which denotes a \"teaching\" or \"lesson\": the verb doce\u014d denotes \"to teach\". In the past, the word was usually used to denote a written proof useful as evidence of a truth or fact. In the computer age , \"document\" usually denotes a primarily textual computer file , including its structure and format, e.g. fonts, colors, and images . Contemporarily, \"document\" is not defined by its transmission medium , e.g., paper, given the existence of electronic documents . \"Documentation\" is distinct because it has more denotations than \"document\". Documents are also distinguished from \" realia \", which are three-dimensional objects that would otherwise satisfy the definition of \"document\" because they memorialize or represent thought; documents are considered more as 2 dimensional representations. Contents [ hide ] 1 Abstract definitions 2 Kinds 3 Drafting 4 History 5 In law 6 See also 7 References 8 Further reading Abstract definitions [ edit ] The concept of \"document\" has been defined [ by whom? ] as \"any concrete or symbolic indication, preserved or recorded, for reconstructing or for proving a phenomenon, whether physical or mental.\" [1] An often cited article concludes that \"the evolving notion of document \" among Jonathan Priest, Otlet , Briet , Sch\u00fcrmeyer , and the other documentalists increasingly emphasized whatever functioned as a document rather than traditional physical forms of documents. The shift to digital technology would seem to make this distinction even more important. Levy's thoughtful analyses have shown that an emphasis on the technology of digital documents has impeded our understanding of digital documents as documents (e.g., Levy, 1994 [2] ). A conventional document, such as a mail message or a technical report, exists physically in digital technology as a string of bits, as does everything else in a digital environment. As an object of study, it has been made into a document. It has become physical evidence by those who study it. \"Document\" is defined in library and information science and documentation science as a fundamental, abstract idea: the word denotes everything that may be represented or memorialized in order to serve as evidence. The classic example provided by Suzanne Briet is an antelope : \"An antelope running wild on the plains of Africa should not be considered a document[;] she rules. But if it were to be captured, taken to a zoo and made an object of study, it has been made into a document. It has become physical evidence being used by those who study it. Indeed, scholarly articles written about the antelope are secondary documents, since the antelope itself is the primary document.\" [3] This opinion has been interpreted as an early expression of actor\u2013network theory . Kinds [ edit ] Documents are sometimes classified as secret , private , or public. They may also be described as drafts or proofs . When a document is copied , the source is denominated the \" original \". Standards are accepted for specific applications in various fields, e.g.: Academia: manuscript , thesis , paper , and journal Business: invoice , quote , RFP , proposal , contract , packing slip , manifest , report (detailed and summary), spread sheet , MSDS , waybill , bill of lading (BOL), financial statement , nondisclosure agreement (NDA), mutual nondisclosure agreement (MNDA), and user guide Government , law , and politics : application , brief , certificate , commission , constitutional document , form , gazette , identity document , license , summons , and white paper Media: mock-up and script Such standard documents can be drafted based on a template . Drafting [ edit ] The page layout of a document is the manner in which information is graphically arranged in the space of the document, e.g., on a page. If the appearance of the document is of concern, page layout is generally the responsibility of a graphic designer . Typography concerns the design of letter and symbol forms and their physical arrangement in the document (see typesetting ). Information design concerns the effective communication of information , especially in industrial documents and public signs . Simple textual documents may not require visual design and may be drafted only by an author , clerk , or transcriber . Forms may require a visual design for their initial fields, but not to complete the forms. History [ edit ] A birth certificate from 1859 Traditionally, the medium of a document was paper and the information was applied to it in ink , either by hand writing (to make a manuscript ) or by mechanical process (e.g., a printing press or laser printer ). Today, some short documents also may consist of sheets of paper stapled together. Historically, documents were inscribed with ink on papyrus (starting in ancient Egypt ) or parchment ; scratched as runes or carved on stone using a sharp tool, e.g., the Tablets of Stone described in the Bible ; stamped or incised in clay and then baked to make clay tablets , e.g., in the Sumerian and other Mesopotamian civilizations. The papyrus or parchment was often rolled into a scroll or cut into sheets and bound into a codex (book). Contemporary electronic means of memorializing and displaying documents include: Monitor of a desktop computer , laptop , tablet PC , et cetera; optionally with a printer to produce a hard copy ; Personal digital assistant (PDA); Dedicated e-book device ; Electronic paper , typically, using the Portable Document Format (PDF); Information appliance ; Digital audio player ; and Radio and television service provider . Digital documents usually require a specific file format in order to be presentable in a specific medium. In law [ edit ] Documents in all forms frequently serve as material evidence in criminal and civil proceedings. The forensic analysis of such a document is within the scope of questioned document examination . For the purpose of cataloging and managing the large number of documents that may be produced during litigation , Bates numbering is often applied to all documents in the lawsuit so that each document has a unique, arbitrary, identification number.

{"question": "who is the national artist for visual who was conferred and died of the same year 1999", "answer": "", "context": "2009 National Artist of the Philippines controversy - Wikipedia 2009 National Artist of the Philippines controversy From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search Insignia of the Order of National Artists The 2009 National Artist of the Philippines controversy refers to the controversial proclamation as National Artists of the Philippines of four individuals via the Presidential prerogative of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo , when the four had not been nominated by the selection committee, composed of representatives from National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA) and the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP). [1] [2] The title National Artist of the Philippines is given to a Filipino who has been given the highest recognition for having made significant contributions to the development of Philippine arts, namely, Music , Dance , Theater , Visual Arts , Literature , Film , Broadcast Arts , Fashion Design and Architecture , and Allied Arts. Such Filipinos are announced, by virtue of a Presidential Proclamation, as National Artist , having been conferred membership in the Order of National Artists. Benefits they enjoy from then on include a monthly pension, medical and life insurance, arrangements for a state funeral, a place of honor at national state functions, and recognition at cultural events. [2] On July 16, 2013, the controversy finally ended after the Supreme Court of the Philippines voted 12-1-2 that voided the four proclamations created by former President Gloria Arroyo that made these people National Artists. [3] Contents [ hide ] 1 Controversy 1.1 President\u2019s prerogative 1.1.1 Alvarez 1.1.2 Caparas 1.2 Committee-shortlisted nominees 1.3 Non-inclusion of Ramon Santos 1.4 Malaca\u00f1ang Honors Committee 2 Prominent protestors 3 Defense 3.1 Arroyo Administration 3.2 Carlo J. Caparas 3.3 Cecilla Guidote-Alvarez 4 Significant events 4.1 Reactions 4.2 Petition with the Supreme Court 4.3 Aftermath 5 References Controversy [ edit ] President\u2019s prerogative [ edit ] The controversy began when conferred the Order of National Artists to seven individuals in July, 2009. [4] Controversy arose from the revelation that musician Ramon Santos had been dropped from the list of nominees short-listed in May that year by the selection committee, and four other individuals had been nominated to the title via \"President\u2019s prerogative\": [1] [2] Cecille Guidote-Alvarez (Theater), Magno Jose \"Carlo\u201d Caparas (Visual Arts and Film), Francisco Ma\u00f1osa (Architecture), and Jose \u201cPitoy\u201d Moreno (Fashion Design) Members of the Philippine art community, including a number of living National Artists of the Philippines, protested that the proclamation politicized the title of National artist, and made it \"a way for President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to accommodate her allies.\" [1] Film director Eddie Romero , himself a National Artist for Film and the Broadcast Arts, explained in an interview that the rules allow the President to pick a National Artist. He noted, however, that: [1] \u201c It seems it\u2019s the first time the presidential prerogative was used to declare four artists. It\u2019s like a wholesale declaration .\u201d National Artist for literature chairman of the Concerned Artists of the Philippines Bienvenido Lumbera , said [1] that in the 2009 nominations, there was \u201c heavy campaigning because the government wanted to ensure the selection of four people. \u201d In addition, specific protests were raised regarding the nomination of NCCA executive director Guidote-Alvarez, because it was purportedly a breach of protocol and propriety, and of Carlo Caparas, because protestors assert that he is not qualified to be nominated under either the \"Visual Arts\" or \"Film\" categories in which he was proclaimed to the order. [1] Alvarez [ edit ] Lumbera, who happened to be a member of the combined \u201cfinal selection committee\" of the NCAA and CCP, noted that: [1] \u201c It was Cecile Guidote-Alvarez, as executive director of the NCCA, who had insisted on the President\u2019s right to add names that were not discussed in the committee. \u201d Calling the situation \"outrageous\", [1] he said that: [1] [2] \u201c She should have not allowed herself to be named as national artist. She\u2019s close to the President. Nobody in the committee thought that she deserved to be named. \" Alvarez heads the NCAA secretariat that receives nominations for national artists. Caparas [ edit ] Complaints regarding Caparas' proclamation centered on the complaints that he did not illustrate the comic books he wrote and therefore did not meet the qualifications for being honored under the visual arts category, [1] [5] and the assertion of protesting artists that his work in the category of Film is supposedly \"sub-par\", being largely exploitation films : \" pito-pito \" (\"seven-seven\") films rush-finished in seven days, and \"massacre films\" whose focus was sensational crimes. [6] [1] [7] [8] Bienvenido Lumbera remarked that Caparas\u2019 nomination was twice rejected by two NCAA panels: [2] \u201c [Caparas] was first proposed as a nominee for literature, but the committee rejected him. He was again proposed as nominee for visual artist but the panel again turned him down. \" Film Academy of the Philippines director general Leo Martinez [2] [9] noted that \" He was obviously added by Malaca\u00f1ang .\" Caparas is known as a vocal supporter of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. [7] Committee-shortlisted nominees [ edit ] Protestors, however, were careful to note that three of the individuals proclaimed as National Artist in 2009 [4] were in fact recommended by the selection committee: [1] Manuel Urbano a.k.a. Manuel Conde (Film and Broadcast), Lazaro Francisco (Literature), and Federico Aguilar Alcuaz (Visual Arts, Painting, Sculpture and Mixed Media). Non-inclusion of Ramon Santos [ edit ] Protesters also lamented the dropping of musician Ramon Santos from the list of new National Artists. Philippine entertainment news website PEP says that a CCP official, who had asked not to be named, revealed that Santos actually won the most number of votes during the selection process. Lumbera verbalized dismay about the snubbing of Santos, saying: [10] \"What makes this even more outrageous is that Ramon Santos, who received a good number of votes in the panel selection, was dropped from the list. The basis for him being scrapped, one doesn't know\" The same report that quoted Lumbera also noted that \"Santos still has not spoken about the whole brouhaha up to this day.[August 4, 2009]\" [10] Malaca\u00f1ang Honors Committee [ edit ] Another aspect of the controversy regards the existence and of the Palace Honors committee which allegedly prepared the final list of nominees, which was eventually enacted by Arroyo. Protesters claim that they were not aware of the existence of such a committee, and that at first, they had no idea who precisely were supposed to be on the committee. [11] According to them, nominating committees were made by the CCP and NCCA, and a final list of nominees was prepared by a joint committee. NCCA sub-commission on the arts head Ricardo de Ungria, one of the panelists involved in the selection process, insisted before a congressional committee meeting on the matter that the arts community \u201c were never apprised of the existence of this animal since the start of the selection process this year or eight years ago. \u201d [12] According to Malaca\u00f1ang and to Cecille Guidote-Alvarez,however, the selection process had always involved the participation of three committees - those of the CCP, the NCCA and the Malaca\u00f1ang honors committee, whose head was Executive Secretary Eduardo Ermita. [12] Prominent protestors [ edit ] Living National Artists of the Philippines who have protested the proclamation of the four new National Artists include: Eddie Romero [1] F. Sionil Jose [6] Arturo Luz [6] Bienvenido Lumbera [1] Virgilio Almario [6] BenCab [6] [13] Salvador Bernal [6] Other prominent critics include prominent Filipino Comic Book artist Gerry Alanguilan , [1] [5] multiple Palanca Award laureate Lourd de Veyra , [1] [8] Film Academy of the Philippines Director General Leo Martinez [9] (who had played a part in the original nomination process), [1] and blogging social critic Vicente Soria de Veyra who wrote a series of blog essays against \"the myth of the national artist\". [ user-generated source? ] [ self-published source? ] [14] Defense [ edit ] Arroyo Administration [ edit ] The Arroyo administration was quick to defend its choices of individuals to be named to the Order of National Artists. Acting Executive Secretary and Presidential political adviser Gabriel Claudio told reporters that: [7] \" I think we can defend [their] track record and qualifications and reasons [for their selection]. \u201d He also said the administration would \u201c stand by the qualifications, qualities, track record and reputation of those named as National Artists. [7] \u201d Carlo J. Caparas [ edit ] Caparas defended his proclamation, saying that other aspirants to the honor ought to wait their turn. [15] \u201c Ganyan talaga kung may something for grabs. E, iisa lang ang pipiliin. Sana, maghintay na lang sila ng tamang panahon sa gusto nilang manalo. Hindi naman ito palakasan. \u201d(That's the way it is whenever something is for grabs. Only one person can be selected. They ought to wait for the right time for them if they want to win. It's not as if this were a case of sucking up.) Kaya wag mag-alala ang mga critics ko, may pagkakataon pa sila o ang mga manok nila na manalo in the future. (So my critics shouldn't worry, they or their fighting cocks still have opportunities to win in the future.) They cannot take the award from me anymore. \" \u201c Baka ang nasa isip nila ay bata pa ako. Pero hindi naman \u2018yon ang basehan. Sino naman ang ko-contest sa decision ng Cultural Center, ng NCCA at ng Malaca\u00f1ang tungkol sa award na ito? Mabuti na nga at ngayon pa lang ay ibinibigay na ang ganitong award sa mga taong nandito. Ang akala kasi nila ay sa matatanda o sa beterano o sa mga patay na ibinibigay ang ganitong award. \u201d (Maybe they think I'm too young. But that's not a valid basis [for a choice]. Who would contest the decision of the Cultural Center, the NCCA, and Malaca\u00f1ang regarding this award? It's a good thing they're giving this award to someone who's still here. They think awards like this should only be given to the old, to veterans, or to the dead.) Caparas said that instead of criticizing his award, entertainment people \u201c should unite and work together to revive the ailing movie and komiks industry. \u201d [15] He attributed his win to the fact that he managed to cross over from comic books to film and television, and saying that his triumph was significant because he was a National Artist who came from the working class. \u201c I am a National Artist who came from the masses, \" the Philippine Daily Inquirer quoted him as saying. \" I work and struggle with them. \u201d He said it was time for a National Artist \u201cw ho the masses can identify with\u2014someone who walks beside them, someone who can inspire them. \u201d Noting that some Filipinos did not even know the National Artists he said \u201c Hopefully, since I am still active in TV and in the movies, this will encourage our countrymen to learn more about our National Artists. \u201d [1] Others who have come to his defense include Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO) director and former Movie and Television Review and Classification Board (MTRCB) chief Manoling Morato , Volunteers Against Crime and Corruption (VACC) head Dante Jimenez , boxer Manny Pacquiao , Senators Ramon Revilla Jr. and Jinggoy Estrada , Komisyon sa Wikang Filipino chair Joe Lad Santos, and Polytechnic University of the Philippines president Dante Guevarra. [16] Cecilla Guidote-Alvarez [ edit ] Guidote-Alvarez also defended her qualifications for receiving the award. \u201c Before you make a judgment, \" she said, \" read my achievements first as an artist. Was I an idiot before I became a national artist? \" [2] As proof of her achievements, she cited previous awards, including the Ramon Magsaysay public service award for the arts, the CCP Gawad Sining Award for Literature, and the Outstanding Women in the Nation's Services award. [2] [17] She also cited her important role in the development of Philippine theater, having founded the Philippine Educational Theatre Association (PETA) in 1967. [17] She asserted that the President had the prerogative to name national artists who were not named in the selection committee's shortlist, and denied lobbying for the award, saying that President Arroyo had \u201c never talked to [her] about it. \" [2] Significant events [ edit ] On July 27, 2009, it was announced to the public that President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo had named seven National Artists for 2009: National Commission on Culture and the Arts executive director Cecille Guidote Alvarez (theater); Manuel Conde (film and broadcast arts, posthumous); Lazaro Francisco (literature, posthumous); Federico Aguilar Alcuaz (visual arts in painting, sculpture and mixed media); Magno Jose Carlo Caparas (visual arts and film); Francisco Ma\u00f1oza (architecture); and Jose \"Pitoy\" Moreno (fashion design). [4] By August 1, 2009, it had been revealed by members of the final selection committee, comprising members from the NCCA and CCP, that only Conde, Alcuaz and Francisco had been short-listed by the selection committee in May. Alvarez, Caparas,Ma\u00f1osa, and Moreno had been included via what was referred to as the \"President\u2019s prerogative\". They also revealed that a fourth nominee, Ramon Santos (shortlisted for music), had not been conferred the order as recommended by committee \u2013 also supposedly part of the president's prerogative. Various artists' groups in the Philippines began to protest, notably the Concerned Artists of the Philippines . Over the next few days, previously conferred members of the Order of National Artists, notably Eddie Romero, F. Sionil Jose, Bienvenido Lumbera, Virgilio Almario, and BenCab [1] [2] A number of members of the Comic Book industry, notably Gerry Alanguilan , also protested. [5] Reactions [ edit ] On August 6, Representatives Ana Theresia Hontiveros and Walden Bello of the Akbayan Party-list filed House Resolution 1305 at the Philippine House of Representatives , calling for a congressional inquiry into the controversy to make sure that the choice of national artists would not be subject to the \u201cwhims\" of ranking government officials. Hontiveros noted: [18] \"Choosing national artists should fundamentally be about contribution in the arts and culture, not patronage or closeness to Malaca\u00f1ang. Choosing eminent symbols of Filipino arts and culture should be left in the hands of the arts community.\" Also on August 15, the ABS CBN News Channel (ANC) hosted an episode of Cheche Lazaro 's Media in Focus, in which the controversial awardees in the person of Caparas and Alavarez were supposed to face off with protesting artists in the person of National Artist Eddie Romero, CCP Chair Emily Abrera , Palanca Award Hall of Fame Awardee Butch Dalisay , and film critic Alexis Tioseco . The first segment of the show allowed Caparas and Dalisay to air their side, while Alvarez was unable to arrive in time to join the second part of a show, which would have had her on a panel with Romero and Abrera, who were protesting the circumstances of her proclamation to the order. [19] On August 7 , protesters gathered at the front ramp of the Cultural Center of the Philippines for a major protest action in the form of a mock \u201cnecrological service\u201d. National Artists who joined the protesters were Napoleon Abueva (visual arts), Arturo Luz (visual arts), Ben Cabrera (visual arts), F. Sionil Jose (literature), Bienvenido Lumbera (literature), Virgilio Almario (literature) and Salvador Bernal (theater design). Relatives of deceased National Artists also participated in the event, with singer Celeste Legaspi representing her late father Cesar Legaspi (National Artist for visual arts), and Raul Locsin representing his late brother Leandro Locsin (National Artist for architecture). Protesters offered black roses \"to symbolize the death of the National Artist Awards.\" [20] During the protests, the Concerned Artists of the Philippines group, through its chair Lumbera informed the media that they \u201cmight seek court injunction\" at the Supreme Court \"against the proclamation of the new national artists.\" [21] After the mock ceremony, participants continued the protest with a motorcade which ended at the offices of the NCCA, where Alvarez serves as head. This led to loud verbal confrontations between protesters and supporters of Alvarez. [22] Petition with the Supreme Court [ edit ] On August 19 a group of National Artists and supporters, led by National Artists for Literature Bienvenido Lumbera and Virgilio Almario, asked filed a 38-page petition at the Supreme Court \"for prohibition, certiorari and injunction with prayer for restraining order to prevent the Palace from conferring the title to respondents,\" to stop \"the release of the monetary benefits, entitlements and emoluments\u2026 to private respondents arising from such conferment,\" and the \"holding of the acknowledgement ceremonies for their recognition.\" [23] The petition asserted that: \"For the President to cavalierly disregard the collective judgment of the CCP and NCCA boards, and substitute her own judgment without a clear indication of the reasons and bases, therefore, is an unacceptable and manifestly grave abuse of discretion.\" On August 25 the Supreme Court issued a status quo order, stopping Malaca\u00f1ang from conferring the honor pending deliberation of the petition to disqualify Alvarez, Caparas, Ma\u00f1osa, and Moreno. Supreme Court spokesman Jose Midas Marquez noted that: \"The court saw the urgency to issue the status quo order and stop the conferment of the awards. It has the same affect [ sic ] as a temporary restraining order.\" [24] The incident involving Caparas has also been the subject of vandalism in Wikipedia , where anonymous editors and newly registered accounts maliciously edited the article, substituting the titles with nonsensical ones containing Tagalog pejoratives . [25] On August 31, 2009 , Dalisay claimed in his column in The Philippine Star that the NCCA web page regarding the selection process for national artists had been changed: [26] When I looked up the National Artists page on the NCCA website, the rules had suddenly changed \u2014 now there was a mention of Executive Order 236 empowering an Honors Committee to make up its own list of NA nominees to the President. That wasn\u2019t there before the recent [National Artist] scandal blew up \u2014 neither the rule nor the role of the committee in the NAA process. On September 14, 2009 , the Philippines' House of Representatives began its committee inquiry into the National Artist controversy. In her testimony before the committee, CCP director and lawyer Lorna Kapunan alleged that the Malaca\u00f1ang honors committee had not actually held a meeting to deliberate on the nominees, and that minutes of the said meeting were therefore forged. Alvarez denied the allegations, and insisted that the selection process for National Artists of the Philippines had always involved the participation of three committees \u2013 those of the CCP, the NCCA and the Malaca\u00f1ang honors committee. [11] [12] On the same day, the CCP submitted to the Supreme Court its 31-page comment regarding the petition to disqualify the National Artists added by Malaca\u00f1ang to the list of nominees. The CCP reiterated its position that the four had not been in the original list of nominees. It also requested the Supreme Court to order the proclamation of its four original choices as 2009's National Artists. [27] Aftermath [ edit ] On July 16, 2013 , the Supreme Court voided former President Arroyo's proclamations awarding National Artists to Alvarez, Caparas, Ma\u00f1osa and Moreno, four years after the said proclamations. Arroyo inserted these names although they were not part of the recommendations created by the Cultural Center of the Philippines and the National Commission on Culture and Arts. The original nominees were Lazaro Francisco (literature), Dr. Ramon Santos (music), Manuel Conde (film and broadcast) and Federico Aguilar Alcuaz (visual arts, painting, sculpture and mixed media). The justices voted 12-1-2 that struck down the 4 proclamations. [3] On June 20, 2014, Dr. Ramon Santos was named as one of six new National Artists.

The show's name is taken from Kenneth Wolstenholme 's famous 1966 World Cup commentary quotation, \" they think it's all over ...it is now!\" and the show used the phrase to sign off each episode. In 2006 the show was axed after 11 years on-air. [1] Contents [ hide ] 1 Overview 1.1 Rounds 1.2 Tie-Breakers 2 Episodes 3 DVD and video releases 3.1 DVD 3.2 Video 4 Other releases 5 References 6 External links Overview [ edit ] The show was originally presented by comedian Nick Hancock . Ex-England football team captain Gary Lineker and ex-England cricket team captain David Gower were team captains from 1995 until they announced their retirement from the show in 2003. They were replaced as team captains by ex-England football goalkeeper David Seaman and ex-England cricketer Phil Tufnell . Former footballer Ian Wright took over from David Seaman in autumn 2004. From October 2005, Boris Becker replaced Tufnell and Lee Mack took over from Hancock as host. Occasionally, a team captain was unable to appear on the show due to other commitments so guest captains were drafted in. Six times World Snooker Champion Steve Davis was a regular choice as guest captain, while Matthew Pinsent , Mark Lawrenson , Mick McCarthy , Sam Torrance , Steve Backley , Sharron Davies , Linford Christie and Michael Johnson also appeared in this role. Additionally, Ian Wright was a guest captain before becoming a permanent team captain. Each team also had a regular panellist. For the team which was originally captained by Gary Lineker this was Rory McGrath for the show's entire run. David Gower was originally teamed up with Lee Hurst . Hurst left the show in 1997 (although he made a reappearance in 2004 on David Seaman's team) and was replaced for the next two series by a rotating line-up of comedians \u2013 Jonathan Ross , Jo Brand , Alan Davies , Julian Clary and Phill Jupitus . Despite regularly admitting to having limited sporting knowledge, Ross became the permanent panellist until leaving the show in 2006, and was replaced by Sean Lock for the World Cup and summer sports special editions . The third member of each team varied from week to week, and would typically be a notable sportsperson, broadcaster or comedian. The show was originally produced for BBC Radio 5 , where it was hosted by Des Lynam . The devisers, Simon Bullivant and Bill Matthews, started work on a TV version in 1993 but it was two years before it made it to air. Des Lynam did record a pilot in early 1994 but decided not to do the already commissioned series, which was then put on hold. In 1999 and 2001, as part of the BBC's Comic Relief broadcasts, one-off special programmes were made called Have I Got Buzzcocks All Over . They combined elements of the show with Have I Got News for You and Never Mind the Buzzcocks , with Angus Deayton as host. Kenneth Wolstenholme was unhappy with the use of the phrase for the title of the show. [2] He wrote in his autobiography that he had contacted the BBC to find out what relevance the title had to his most famous line, uttered 30 years earlier. However, when the show was first commissioned, he did accept a fee to re-record his famous commentary for the opening titles, as the original was unusable. Rounds [ edit ] Throughout the series, the rounds varied each week. Examples include: Excuses , where the teams are shown a clip of a sportsperson or a team, and are asked what excuse they gave for a sporting or personal misdemeanour. Examples include Tommy Docherty explaining that Scotland lost 7\u20130 in the 1954 World Cup to Uruguay because \"they were shattered just standing for the National Anthem\", and Scottish tennis player Andy Murray claimed that he vomited on the court at the US Open in 2005 because he'd been drinking an isotonic drink to stop him from cramping, but he drank too much too quickly. On a special edition video-only episode of No Holds Barred , Gary's team was asked for Tommy Docherty's excuse for Manchester United's infamous relegation of 1973\u201374, with Lineker's answer \"He wanted to bring pleasure to millions?\". Another edition of the excuses round saw the 1992 Manchester United team blame Rod Stewart for ruining their Old Trafford pitch at a concert a week before the season ended. Even though the gig was on 7 June 1991, a full year earlier. [3] Celebrations , where the teams are shown a clip of a sportsperson celebrating in a fanciful way, and are asked what the celebration is in aid of. Examples include Arsenal striker Thierry Henry celebrating a goal by recreating the Budweiser \" Whassup? \" advert, and Manchester United midfielder Lee Sharpe celebrating a goal by recreating a pose of his boyhood hero Elvis Presley . One of the more memorable reactions to not winning this round occurred when Matthew Corbett and Sooty were guests and when denied points, Sooty went on to squirt Nick in the face with a water pistol. Sporting Bluff , in which the teams are given three statements about a sportsperson and have to guess which one is true. What's Going On? , where the teams are shown a sporting clip and are asked to decipher what's going on, quite literally. Examples include former cricket umpire Dickie Bird taking part in a photo opportunity with the Yorkshire players picked for the England cricket team , dressed in a chef's outfit and cooking them Yorkshire puddings , and serial practical joker (and Eric Cantona lookalike) Karl Power joining the Manchester United team for a photo before a Champions League match in 2001. Photo-fit , where the teams are shown a picture of three sportspersons merged into one. The teams then have to guess who they are. Sometimes after the sportspersons are revealed, they are asked for the connection between them for a bonus point. On many occasions, Rory McGrath liked to joke that he recognised the person in the photo as an ex-girlfriend he'd previously had sexual encounters with. Author Author , in which the teams hear an extract from a sporting autobiography and attempt to identify the author. Quotes include former Liverpool F.C. manager G\u00e9rard Houllier on why he turns down offers of international coaching and a quote from athlete Roger Black 's autobiography on his admiration of David Gower. Sing When You're Winning , in which the teams must complete the lyrics to a chant performed by football fans or the Barmy Army . A memorable moment from this round saw Chris Eubank complete a poem by the Barnsley F.C. poet, with the line \"I'm having a laugh\", when the line was \"We'll be champions come May\". Handbags , where the teams must work out the reasons for a rift between sportspersons. Examples of rifts include football team Peterborough United F.C. and Victoria Beckham over the rights to use the nickname \"Posh\", and athlete David Bedford and communications company InfoNXX over the 118 118 runners looking like him. Grandstand , in which the teams are shown a bizarre multi-sport event and are asked to come up with events played in them. These include the Eskimo Olympics, the Naked Olympics and the Tough Guy Sports. The Treble , where the teams are shown three sportspersons and three items, and have to link each sportsperson to an item. The Beckham Challenge , where the teams are asked an on-the-buzzer question about David Beckham and his family. The first team to get the answer right gets further bonus questions, similar to University Challenge . This was later changed to having separate questions for each team. Variants to this round include Sven-Mania (with questions about then-England manager Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson ), Rooney-Mania (with questions about Wayne Rooney ) and Gaffer-Mania (with questions about football managers in general). Electronic Pencil , where the teams are shown a brief sporting clip, which is then paused, or a doctored photo of a sportsperson with items removed. The teams use the electronic pencil to predict the direction of the athlete or the ball, or what the missing items were. The round was dropped after series 2 but revived for the 100th show in 2001. Injury Board , in which the teams pick a number between 1 and 12. Behind each number is a sports person and another person or item. The teams try to work out how the latter injured the former. Examples include Newbury rugby club and some Vaseline (to which guest Julian Clary suggested \"maybe there was sand in it,\") and Dennis Wise and a toilet seat. This round was also a parody of A Question of Sport , another BBC TV quiz show. Feel The Sportsman , one of the most popular rounds of the show, in which the regular panellists have to try to identify a mystery guest, or their sporting notability, by touch whilst blindfolded. Guests subjected to a groping include Will Carling , Ashia Hansen , Victor Ubogu , Jonah Lomu (who infamously appeared minutes after Chris Eubank expressed his dislike for him), Andy Fordham , Manc Union Paintball Team, Arsenal Women's Football Team (which Rory guessed right on the whistle), Aylesbury United F.C. in their infamous 1995 FA Cup conga goal celebration. One notable variant in 2001 saw the regulars feeling an animal, having been shown a clip of Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson on the Italian version of the show in a \"Feel the Animal\" round. David Gower and Jonathan Ross correctly guessed their animal (a zebra ) but Gary Lineker and Rory McGrath failed to get theirs (an alligator \u2013 they failed to even touch it), with McGrath removing his blindfold and running off the set in panic. Another famous example involved a slight change in the rules, in that Sharron Davies , who was a guest (rather than a regular) contestant took part in the feeling. The sportsman was her then husband Derek Redmond , whom she recognised. Claim To Fame , introduced in 2005, saw a sportsperson subjected to a line of questioning by the panel to determine their claim to fame. Mystery people include Paul Barber (a member of the gold medal winning British 1988 Olympic hockey team), Judy Grinham (gold medal winning 100m backstroke swimmer at the 1956 Olympics) and Tommy Gemmell , from the Celtic European Cup winning team of 1967. The Physical Challenge , where the teams are subject to displaying their physique on an exercise bike, tricycle or other exercise apparatus. The harder they pedal, the faster an image appears on screen, and the teams must name the image before moving onto the next one. The team captain starts off before a klaxon is sounded, then the regular sidekick takes over. The Name Game , in which the regular sidekick has to give clues about a famous sportsperson for the other team members to guess. Variants include the sidekick having to draw the clues, giving clues as to team names and performing impressions mimes of the sportsperson. One famous incident in this round saw Rory get a point deduction for giving clues like \"Same first name as Ian Rush , same last name as Ian Botham \". Rory also got away with pretending Gary gave an answer when he didn't, by saying \"That's right, speak up!\". He also criticised the media hype over Ryan Giggs 's winning FA Cup semi-final goal against Arsenal , by giving the clue \"Welsh football player, scored what is probably the most overrated goal of the season\". Sporting Vogue , introduced in 2005, where the team captain has to strike a famous pose by a sportsperson for their teammates to guess. School Sports Day , shown only on the video-exclusive No Holds Barred episode, was a pre-recorded segment featuring the regulars participating in a school sports day at King's College School as though it was covered by Grandstand , with Nick as the presenter and Gerald Sinstadt as the commentator. The events were the Egg-and-spoon race , the Three-legged race , the Egg Catching (with England cricketer Nasser Hussain throwing the eggs), the Obstacle course and the Sack race . Although Gary won the individual contest, David's team earned more points in the sports day and back in the studio were awarded one point for their efforts. Grand Prix , shown only on the video-exclusive Full Throttle episode, was another pre-recorded segment featuring the regulars participating in a six-lap race in \"Formula 27 dinky cars\" at Silverstone , using similar on-screen graphics to Formula 1 coverage on ITV at the time (even breaking into a \"commercial break\" for the No Holds Barred video near to the climax of the race, only to return just before Lee span off the track, which was ripping on ITV holding commercial breaks during key moments in the races), and a commentator imitating Murray Walker . Lee and David raced in Williams -coloured cars, while Gary and Rory raced in Jordan -coloured cars. Lee span out on the final lap and was disqualified. David won the race, winning 10 points for his team. Gary and Rory finished joint second, winning 5 points each, thus leading to Nick back in the studio declaring the race \"a complete waste of a day\". Tie-Breakers [ edit ] All episodes ending with a tie score or series ending with the number of episodes tied finish with a tie-breaker. Sometimes, the tie-breaker refers to incidents from previously in the episode. These have included: A sports general knowledge question, sometimes from the quiz books endorsed by team captains Gary Lineker or David Gower. An episode featuring England cricket captain Nasser Hussain ended with Nick tossing a coin and getting Nasser, who had previous bad luck with coin tosses, to call Heads or Tails. A game of musical chairs featuring the regulars. A mechanical bull or surfboard, which the panellists (usually Jonathan Ross versus Rory McGrath, or Jonathan versus his brother Paul in the surfboard example) ride, with the panellist who stays on for the longest before falling off winning. A game of round-the-table table tennis between all the panellists. An arm-wrestling match between David and Gary. A \"pseudo sumo\" match between David and Gary, with the two captains in inflatable sumo suits. A race between David and Gary on tea trays with wheels, in honour of British Winter Olympic bronze medallist skeleton racer Alex Coomber A wrestling match in a pool of mashed potato between David and Gary, with the audience cheering for who they thought won. A coconut shy -type game where, following a dressing room incident between Alex Ferguson and David Beckham where Ferguson reportedly kicked a football boot which hit Beckham in the head, all the panellists took turns to kick a football boot at cardboard cut-outs of Beckham's face. A toy fishing game between Phil Tufnell and David Seaman . A game of blow football between Boris Becker and Ian Wright .

{"question": "where does the movie proof of life take place", "answer": "who rises to the", "context": "Proof of Life - Wikipedia Proof of Life From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search This article is about the film. For other uses, see Proof of Life (disambiguation) . Proof of Life Theatrical release poster Directed by Taylor Hackford Produced by Taylor Hackford Charles Mulvehill Written by Tony Gilroy Starring Meg Ryan Russell Crowe David Morse David Caruso Gottfried John Music by Danny Elfman Cinematography S\u0142awomir Idziak Edited by Sheldon Kahn John Smith Production company Castle Rock Entertainment Bel-Air Entertainment Anvil Films Distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures Release date December\u00a04,\u00a02000 ( 2000-12-04 ) (United States) Running time 135 minutes Country United States Language English Italian Spanish Budget $65 million [1] Box office $62.8 million [1] Proof of Life is a 2000 American action thriller film directed and produced by Taylor Hackford . The title refers to a phrase commonly used to indicate proof that a kidnap victim is still alive. The film's screenplay was written by Tony Gilroy , who also was a co-executive producer, and was inspired by William Prochnau 's Vanity Fair magazine article \"Adventures in the Ransom Trade\", [2] [3] and Thomas Hargrove 's book The Long March to Freedom [4] in which Hargrove recounts how his release was negotiated by Thomas Clayton, who went on to be the founder of kidnap-for-ransom consultancy Clayton Consultants, Inc. The film stars Meg Ryan and Russell Crowe . During production, the two lead actors had a romantic affair. At the time, Ryan was married to Dennis Quaid , but the two divorced in 2001. The film garnered much reportage in the tabloid press in association with the lead actors' affair. [5] The film is dedicated to Will Gaffney, an actor who was David Morse ' stand-in. He was killed in an on-set accident during a scene in which Morse was not available, due to a family illness.

Though Alice is unhappy at this most recent move, she agrees to stay. While driving one morning through the city, Peter is caught in traffic and then ambushed and abducted by guerrilla rebels of the Liberation Army of Tecala (ELT). Believing that Peter is working on Quad Carbon's oil pipeline , ELT soldiers lead him through the jungle . Terry Thorne ( Russell Crowe ), a former member of the British Special Air Service , arrives in Tecala fresh from a successful hostage rescue in Chechnya . As an expert negotiator in kidnapping -and- ransom cases, he is assigned by his company, Luthan Risk, to bargain for Peter's safe return. Unfortunately, it is learned that Quad Carbon is on the verge of bankruptcy and takeover , and therefore has no insurance coverage for kidnapping, so they cannot afford Thorne's services. Despite Alice's pleas to stay, Thorne leaves the country. Alice is then assigned a corrupt local hostage negotiator, who immediately urges her to pay the ELT's first ransom demand: a $50,000 \"good faith\" payment. Not knowing what to do, Alice agrees, but the transaction is stopped by Thorne who (due to his conscience) has returned to help. He is aided by Dino ( David Caruso ), a competing negotiator and ex\u2013 Green Beret . Over the next few months, Thorne uses a radio to speak with an ELT contact, and the two argue over terms for Peter's release\u2014including a ransom payment that Alice can afford. Thorne and Alice bond through the ordeal, forming an implicit attraction. They eventually negotiate a sum of $650,000. Meanwhile, Peter has become a prisoner at the ELT's jungle base camp. There, he befriends another hostage named Kessler ( Gottfried John )\u2014a missionary and former member of the French Foreign Legion \u2014who has lived in the camp for nineteen months. The two concoct an escape plan, but during their attempt they are quickly tracked by the ELT. Kessler falls into a river after being shot in the shoulder and manages to escape, but Peter steps on a trap and is recaptured. Kessler is found and hospitalized. In the hospital he claims he heard a gunshot at the time Peter was recaptured, and thus believes he is dead. Thorne can not believe this, but his ELT contact refuses to respond to his calls. Luckily, one of Alice's young maids recognized his voice over the radio and reveals he is a government official. Thorne goes to a parade ceremony and confronts the contact; he confirms that Peter is indeed alive, but because of the ELT's escalating war with the government and Peter's knowledge of the terrain, the ELT will no longer negotiate. At Thorne's urging Alice convinces the Tecala government that the ELT is mounting an attack on the pipeline being built through their territory. This forces the government army to mobilize, thus forcing a bulk of the camp's ELT troops to mobilize for a counter-attack. Thorne, Dino, and several associates are then inserted by helicopter and raid the weakened ELT base. They overcome the camp's soldiers, free Peter and another hostage, and then fly back to the city, where Alice happily reunites with her husband. Thorne and Alice share a final intimate moment before the latter departs with Peter on an immediate flight to the U.S. Cast [ edit ] Meg Ryan as Alice Bowman Russell Crowe as Terry Thorne David Morse as Peter Bowman Pamela Reed as Janis Goodman David Caruso as Dino Anthony Heald as Ted Fellner Michael Byrne as Lord Luthan Stanley Anderson as Jerry Gottfried John as Eric Kessler Alun Armstrong as Wyatt Michael Kitchen as Ian Havery Margo Martindale as Ivy Mario Ernesto S\u00e1nchez as Arturo Fernandez Pietro Sibille as Juaco Vicky Hern\u00e1ndez as Maria Norma Mart\u00ednez as Norma Carlos Blanchard as Carlos Rowena King as Pamela Diego Trujillo as Eliodoro Background [ edit ] Although the producers wanted to film in Colombia , due to the dangers that guerrillas posed in that country at the time, the movie was mainly filmed in Ecuador . The large piles of money used to pay for the rescue were sucres , the Ecuadorian national currency at the time of the filming. Tecala's geographic and urban appearance and its political characteristics were based loosely on a mix of several Andean countries. The ELT's characterization appears to be primarily based on the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). Coincidentally, Colombia's second largest guerrilla group is the Ej\u00e9rcito de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional or ELN. Control Risks , a risk consulting firm, was hired to provide security for the cast and crew while filming on location. The firm also served as inspiration for kidnap and ransom consulting seen in the film. [7] The movie end credit and post-script says: \"Inspired by the VANITY FAIR article 'Adventures in the Ransom Trade' by William Prochnau and by the book Long March to Freedom by Thomas Hargrove. Tecala [ edit ] The Republic of Tecala, where most of Proof of Life is set, is a fictional South American country. Tecala has long been the scene of an internal conflict between its government forces and the Liberation Army of Tecala (ELT). The ELT was originally a Marxist guerrilla group supported by the Soviet Union , but after the Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991, the ELT's primary source of funding fell through, and they began kidnapping people for ransom to fund their operations. A map seen in the film is that of Ecuador . The country's capital Quito was chosen along with the eastern jungle and the nearby city of Ba\u00f1os de Agua Santa in the Ecuadorian Andes . Release [ edit ] The film opened in wide release in the United States on December 8, 2000 for 2,705 screens. The opening weekend's gross was $10,207,869 and the total receipts for the U.S. run were $32,598,931. The international box-office receipts were $30,162,074, for total receipts of $62,761,005. The film was in wide release in the U.S. for twelve weeks (eighty days). In its widest release, the film was featured in 2,705 theaters across the country. [1] Reception [ edit ] Critical response [ edit ] Stephen Holden, film critic for The New York Times , did not think the film worked well and opined that the actors did not connect. He wrote, \"[the film displays] a gaping lack of emotional connection among the characters in a romantic triangle that feels conspicuously unromantic... what ultimately sinks this stylish but heartless film is a flat lead performance by the eternally snippy Meg Ryan... Ms. Ryan expresses no inner conflict, nor much of anything else beyond a mounting tension. Even when her wide blue eyes well up with tears, the pain she conveys is more the frustration of a little girl who has misplaced her doll than any deep, empathetic suffering.\" [8] Critic David Ansen gave the film a mixed review, writing, Taylor Hackford's thriller Proof of Life leaves a lot to be desired, but it's got its hands on a fascinating subject...To be fair, Tony Gilroy's screenplay keeps the romance on the back burner...Thorne is the most compelling aspect of Proof of Life, thanks to Crowe's quiet, hard-bitten charisma. It's a part Bogart once would have played\u2014the amoral tough guy who rises to the moral occasion\u2014and Crowe gives it just the right note of gravel-voiced masculinity. But neither Crowe, Ryan nor the topical subject keeps Proof of Life from feeling recycled. For all the up-to-the-minute research, the movie still gives off the musty scent of Hollywood contrivance. [9] Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 40% based on 115 reviews; the average rating is 5.3/10. The consensus is: \"Despite its promising premise and superstar cast, Proof of Life is just a routine thriller that doesn't offer anything new.\" [10] Awards [ edit ] The film was nominated for four Blockbuster Entertainment Awards ; Favorite Actor \u2013 Suspense, Favorite Actress - Suspense, Favorite Supporting Actress \u2013 Suspense and Favorite Supporting Actress \u2013 Suspense.

{"question": "where did the saying monkey's uncle come from", "answer": "", "context": "Monkey's uncle - Wikipedia Monkey's uncle From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search The term monkey's uncle , most notably seen in the idiom \"(well) I'll be a monkey's uncle\", is used to express complete surprise, amazement or disbelief. [1] It can also be used to acknowledge the impossibility of a situation, in the same way that \"pigs might fly\" is used. An example is if one says: \"I may agree that if two plus two equals five, then I am a monkey's uncle\". \"I'll be a monkey's uncle\" has been said to date from after 1925, the date of the widely publicized Scopes Trial in the United States, where the term first appears. [2] The Oxford English Dictionary 's earliest example is the phrase If that's a joke I'm a monkey's uncle, from an Ohio newspaper on 8 February 1925. [3] It was originally a sarcastic remark made by creationists . [4] The notion \"that [people] were descended from apes was considered blasphemous...by Darwin's contemporaries\", and it was for this reason that the sarcastic phrase came into use. [5] Michael Quinion notes that the phrase Monkey's uncle occurs in a parody of Longfellow 's The Song of Hiawatha which was reprinted in James Parton 's The Humorous Poetry of the English Language , published in 1881, and observes This may be just an accident of invention, but the date fits . [6] Monkey's Uncle is the name of a song by the Selecter on their album Reel to Real criticizing religious dogma that contradicts scientific evidence.

[1] According to the U.S. Senate , as of February 28, 2018, a tie-breaking vote had been cast 264 times by 36 vice presidents. [2] The following is the list of tie-breaking votes cast by vice presidents of the United States . Contents [ hide ] 1 Historical significance 2 List of presidents of the Senate by number of tie-breaking votes 3 List of tie-breaking votes since 1945 4 References 5 External links Historical significance [ edit ] Play media When there is a tie in the Senate, as seen here for the confirmation of Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education, the Vice President (in this case, Mike Pence ) has to step in to break the tie. The first President of the Senate, John Adams , cast 29 tie-breaking votes. His votes protected the president's sole authority over the removal of appointees, influenced the location of the national capital, and prevented war with Great Britain . On at least one occasion he persuaded senators to vote against legislation that he opposed, and he frequently lectured the Senate on procedural and policy matters. Adams's political views and his active role in the Senate made him a natural target for critics of the Washington administration. Toward the end of his first term, as a result of a threatened resolution that would have silenced him except for procedural and policy matters, he began to exercise more restraint in the hope of realizing the goal shared by many of his successors: election in his own right as President of the United States. [3] In 2001, during the 107th Congress , the Senate was divided 50\u201350 between Republicans and Democrats and thus Dick Cheney 's tie-breaking vote gave the Republicans the Senate majority. However, because the 107th Congress was sworn in on January 3, while the president and vice president were not sworn in until the 20th, Democrats technically held a 51\u201350 majority in the Senate for the 17 days while Al Gore was still Vice President. However, no substantive legislative work was done during that time. Mike Pence cast six tie-breaking votes during his first year in office, the most for any vice president. He broke a tie with John Adams , William Wheeler , and Alben Barkley , who all cast four tie-breaking votes within their first year. [2] This was also the most tie-breaking votes in any single year since 1872, when there were seven cast by Schuyler Colfax during the Grant administration . [2] In recent years, the increased threat of a filibuster has led to a rise in the use of cloture to end debate in the Senate, especially on high-profile issues where the Senate is sharply divided, thus rendering the vice president's tie-breaking vote increasingly unnecessary or unhelpful, since the invocation of cloture requires a three-fifths majority, rather than a simple one. However, the cloture requirement was reduced to a simple majority for all executive and judicial nominations in 2013 (except for Supreme Court nominations, which were included in 2017), which led to the first ever use of a tie-breaking vote to confirm a Cabinet member when Pence broke a tie to confirm Betsy DeVos in 2017. In general, tie-breaking votes have become less common over time, both in terms of absolute frequency and in terms of the average number of such votes cast by individual vice presidents. More tie-breaking votes were cast by the first 12 vice presidents in the 61 years from 1789 to 1850 (135) than have been cast by the 36 vice presidents in the 168 years since then (129). [2] List of presidents of the Senate by number of tie-breaking votes [ edit ] As of February 28, 2018, there have been 264 tie-breaking votes cast by 36 presidents of the senate while 12 other vice presidents did not cast any tie-breaking votes. The average number of tie-breaking votes cast by a Vice President may be considered to be 0 (the mode : 12 cast no tie-breaking votes), 3 (the median value: half cast more, half cast less), or about 5.5 (the mean value: 264 votes divided among 48 Presidents of the Senate).

{"question": "robin and the 7 hoods mr booze scene", "answer": "", "context": "Robin and the 7 Hoods - Wikipedia Robin and the 7 Hoods From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search Robin and the 7 Hoods theatrical release poster Directed by Gordon Douglas Produced by Frank Sinatra Screenplay by David R. Schwartz Starring Frank Sinatra Dean Martin Bing Crosby Sammy Davis Jr. Music by Nelson Riddle Cinematography William H. Daniels Edited by Sam O'Steen Distributed by Warner Bros. Release date June\u00a024,\u00a01964 ( 1964-06-24 ) (USA) Running time 124 minutes Country United States Language English Box office c. $4,200,000 (US/ Canada) [1] Robin and the 7 Hoods is a 1964 American musical film directed by Gordon Douglas and starring Frank Sinatra , Dean Martin , Sammy Davis Jr. and Bing Crosby . The picture features Peter Falk , Barbara Rush , and an un-credited Edward G. Robinson . Written by David R. Schwartz, the film transplants the Robin Hood legend to a 1930s Chicago gangster setting, though this story's utterly opportunistic Marian is very different from the faithful Maid Marian of the original legend. Produced by Frank Sinatra , the film introduced the hit song \" My Kind of Town \" by Jimmy Van Heusen and Sammy Cahn , which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song and achieved a career of its own independent of the film. Contents [ hide ] 1 Plot 2 Cast 3 Reception 4 Music 4.1 Songs 5 Production 6 Stage musical 7 Home media releases 8 See also 9 References 10 External links Plot [ edit ] \"Big\" Jim Stevens ( Edward G. Robinson ), undisputed boss of the Chicago underworld, gets an unexpected birthday present from his ambitious lieutenant, Guy Gisborne ( Peter Falk ). Instead of a stripper popping out of the cake, Big Jim gets shot by all the guests. With the mob boss out of the way, Gisborne takes over. He orders all the other gangsters in town to pay him protection money, but declares it's still \"All for One.\" The news does not sit well with Big Jim's fellow gangster, Robbo, and a gangland war breaks out. Robbo ( Frank Sinatra ) recruits pool hustler Little John ( Dean Martin ), who demonstrates his billiards skills while singing \"A Man Who Loves His Mother,\" plus quick-draw artist Will ( Sammy Davis Jr. ) and a few other hoods, but they are still greatly outnumbered. In addition, the corrupt Sheriff Octavius Glick is on Gisborne's payroll. Gisborne and Robbo come up with the same idea, to destroy the other's gambling joint on the same night, with Will enjoying every moment of shooting up Gisborne's place (\"Bang! Bang!\"). Big Jim's refined, educated daughter, Marian ( Barbara Rush ), shows up. She asks Robbo to avenge her father's death (wrongfully attributed to the sheriff), a request which Robbo flatly refuses. Gisborne disposes of the sheriff. Marian then invites Robbo to dinner and gives him $50,000, falsely assuming that Robbo did as she had asked. Robbo refuses the money, so Marian attempts to seduce him into joining forces to take over the whole town. Robbo turns her down. When she sends the money to his under-repair gambling club, Robbo donates it to a boys' orphanage. Alan A. Dale ( Bing Crosby ), the orphanage's director, notifies the newspapers about this good deed. A new Chicago star is born: a gangster who robs from the rich and gives to the poor. Robbo finds it useful to have the public on his side. He invites the delighted Dale to join his gang, having him handle all the charities. Dale starts the Robbo Foundation and opens a string of soup kitchens, free clinics and orphan shelters. He even gives green, feathered hats and bows and arrows to the orphans, while thoroughly milking the Robin Hood image. In the meantime, Robbo and Little John give tips to Dale on how to improve his own image (\"Style\"). Robbo's joint reopens and is an instant hit while Gisborne, whose place is now empty, is infuriated. He and the new sheriff, Potts, organize a police raid. Robbo has anticipated this and when a few switches are pulled, the entire club is disguised as a mission. The sheriff and Gisborne burst in to find Robbo's gang singing gospel songs and preaching the sins of alcohol, complete with hymnals and tambourines (\"Mr. Booze\"). Robbo is framed for Glick's murder. At the trial, Gisborne and Potts claim that Robbo planned the whole thing. Dale tries to teach the despondent orphans to view this as a lesson (\"Don't Be a Do-Badder\"). The jury finds Robbo innocent. Wearing a green suit, Robbo publicly thanks everyone in Chicago (\"My Kind of Town\"). When he returns to his club, Robbo finds every one of his charities is now a front for counterfeiting . The soup kitchen smuggles fake bills in soup cans over state lines. Robbo also finds Little John living it up in Marian's mansion. Marian is willing to keep Robbo as a front, as long as she is in charge. Robbo shows his contempt for her and leaves, with Little John following him out the door. Marian finds another willing partner in Gisborne, but the gangster is no match for Robbo and is killed. Robbo tells a shocked Marian to clear out of town. She instead turns public opinion against him, starting a Women's League for Better Government and framing Robbo for the counterfeiting ring that she and Little John started. Unable to fight an angry mob of women, Robbo and his gang flee. Robbo and his merry men are reduced to working as Santa Clauses to solicit charitable donations. They watch dumbfounded as Marian steps out of a car with her latest partner, Alan A. Dale, who casually gives the Santas money before going off with Marian. Cast [ edit ] Frank Sinatra as Robbo Dean Martin as Little John Sammy Davis, Jr. as Will Bing Crosby as Alan A. Dale Peter Falk as Guy Gisborne Barbara Rush as Marian Stevens Victor Buono as Deputy Sheriff Alvin Potts Robert Foulk as Sheriff Octavius Glick Edward G. Robinson as Big Jim (uncredited) Chet Allen as one of the Hoods Hank Henry as one of the Hoods, \"Six Seconds\" Phil Crosby as Hood Allen Jenkins as \"Vermin\" Jack La Rue as \"Tomatoes\" Phil Arnold as \"Hatrack\" Bernard Fein as \"Bananas\" Richard Simmons as Prosecutor Joseph Ruskin as \"Twitch\" Maurice Manson as Dignitary Barry Kelley as Police Chief Harry Wilson as Hood Richard Bakalyan as Hood Hans Conried as Mr. Ricks Sig Ruman as Hammacher Bill Zuckert as Prosecutor Robert Carricart as Blue Jaw, Gisborne's assistant Cast notes Peter Lawford was originally cast as Alan A. Dale, but was replaced with Bing Crosby following a break in Sinatra's relationship with Lawford. The break stemmed from a scheduled visit to Sinatra's home by Lawford's brother-in-law, President John F. Kennedy during a 1962 West Coast trip. [2] Attorney General Robert Kennedy , who was long concerned about Sinatra's rumored ties with underworld figures, encouraged the President to change his plans and stay at Crosby's home, which (it was maintained) could provide better security for the President. The change came at the last minute, after Sinatra made extensive arrangements for the promised and eagerly awaited presidential visit, including the construction of a helipad . Sinatra was furious, believing that Lawford had failed to intercede with the Kennedys on his behalf, and ostracized him from the Rat Pack . [3] Sinatra and Lawford never spoke again. Sinatra endorsed incumbent Democrat Pat Brown for his unsuccessful re-election as governor of California in 1966, and then backed Vice-President Hubert Humphrey in his equally unsuccessful run for the presidency in 1968. These were the last two Democrats that Sinatra gave his public support to. Ironically, Crosby, a staunch Republican, ended up cast in Lawford's role. [4] Reception [ edit ] Variety commented: \"Warner Bros. has a solid money entry in \u201cRobin and the Seven Hoods,\u201d a spoof on gangster pix of bygone days sparked by the names of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Bing Crosby to give marquee power. . . Performance-wise, Falk comes out best. His comic gangster is a pure gem and he should get plenty of offers after this. Sinatra, of course, is smooth and Crosby in a \u201cdifferent\u201d type of role rates a big hand. Martin seems lost in the shuffle. Davis is slick and Miss Rush, going heavy, is beautiful to look at.\" [5] Bosley Crowther of The New York Times said, inter alia: \"The minor musical whimsey that arrived at the Palace and other theaters yesterday under the just-too-cunning title of \u201cRobin and the 7 Hoods\u201d is almost as strained and archaic in the fable it has to tell of Prohibition-era gangsters in Chicago as the fable of Robin Hood it travesties. Dishing up Frank Sinatra as the leader of a mob that enhances its public image by giving large sums of money to charity, it runs through some all-too-familiar plot arrangements and farce routines that have a fleeting and far-away resemblance to some of the stuff in the old Damon Runyon tales.\" [6] Michael Thornton, writing in the British newspaper The Sunday Express had this to say as part of his review. \"I must confess I was yawning up to the moment Bing Crosby made his quiet and studious entrance as the unworldly secretary of a children\u2019s orphanage. The years have not dealt lightly with Mr. Crosby. The tips of the famous toupee have receded still further back upon that time-honoured face. But after some moments of horrifying suspicion that he had been introduced as a mute stooge for the Sinatra Clan, the Old Master opened his mouth to sing again and to prove that his sweetness of tone remains unimpaired and undiminished for all his years of seniority.\" [7] The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: 2004: AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs : \" My Kind of Town \" \u2013 Nominated [8] Music [ edit ] Main article: Robin and the 7 Hoods (album) Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen wrote the score. Crosby, still a major movie star at the time who had top billing over Sinatra in their last film together, High Society , sang more songs than Sinatra in this film as well. \" My Kind of Town \" is the centerpiece number of the film. Orchestral versions of the song are the primary element of the opening and closing credits. A dance band also plays the song in Robbo's speakeasy. Sinatra sings the song to the citizens outside the courthouse after having been framed for, and acquitted of, murdering the sheriff. Songs [ edit ] \"All for One and One for All\" - Peter Falk and others \"Any Man Who Loves His Mother\" - Dean Martin \"Bang! Bang!\" - Sammy Davis, Jr. \"Style\" - Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin \"Mr. Booze\" - Bing Crosby and others \"Don't be a Do-Badder\" - Bing Crosby and the Mitchell Boy Singers \"My Kind of Town\" - Frank Sinatra \"Don't Be a Do-Badder\" (reprise) - Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr. Production [ edit ] Robin and the 7 Hoods was filmed in November\u2013December 1963. According to Robert Osborne , primary host for Turner Classic Movies , this was a very troubled production for Sinatra due to two outside events, so much so that he considered not completing the film. Close friend President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, and Sinatra's son, Frank Sinatra, Jr. , was kidnapped and held for ransom only weeks later. Stage musical [ edit ] A new version of Robin and the 7 Hoods , with a book by Rupert Holmes , premiered on stage July 30, 2010 at the Old Globe Theater in San Diego , California. Updated to the early 1960s, it includes only one of the film's songs, \"My Kind of Town,\" but features 18 others composed by Cahn and Van Heusen, among them \"Come Fly With Me\" and \"Ain't That a Kick in the Head?\" The piece ran throughout August 2010. Casey Nicholaw directed and choreographed the musical, set in the Mad Men era of 1962. The story is about a likable gangster hoping to get out of the crime business. A do-gooding TV reporter likens him to a modern-day Robin Hood. [9] Home media releases [ edit ] Robin and the 7 Hoods has been released on a number of home video editions including individually [10] and as part of the deluxe multi-movie set The Rat Pack Ultimate Collector's Edition . [11] The individual DVD editions cases depicted a portrait of Sinatra, Martin, Davis Jr and Crosby with guns in their hands. However, since Crosby's character is not involved in the criminal operations of the group, the portrait was later altered to show him without the gun.

[1] It is equal to the energy transferred to (or work done on) an object when a force of one newton acts on that object in the direction of its motion through a distance of one metre (1 newton metre or N\u22c5m). It is also the energy dissipated as heat when an electric current of one ampere passes through a resistance of one ohm for one second. It is named after the English physicist James Prescott Joule (1818\u20131889). [2] [3] [4] In terms firstly of base SI units and then in terms of other SI units: J = kg \u22c5 m 2 s 2 = N \u22c5 m = Pa \u22c5 m 3 = W \u22c5 s = C \u22c5 V , {\\displaystyle {\\text{J}}={\\frac {{\\text{kg}}\\cdot {\\text{m}}^{2}}{{\\text{s}}^{2}}}={\\text{N}}\\cdot {\\text{m}}={\\text{Pa}}\\cdot {\\text{m}}^{3}={\\text{W}}\\cdot {\\text{s}}={\\text{C}}\\cdot {\\text{V}},} where kg is the kilogram , m is the metre , s is the second , N is the newton , Pa is the pascal , W is the watt , C is the coulomb , and V is the volt . One joule can also be defined as: The work required to move an electric charge of one coulomb through an electrical potential difference of one volt, or one \"coulomb-volt\" (C\u22c5V). This relationship can be used to define the volt. The work required to produce one watt of power for one second, or one \"watt-second\" (W\u22c5s) (compare kilowatt-hour \u2013  3.6 megajoules). This relationship can be used to define the watt.

As with every International System of Units (SI) unit named for a person, the first letter of its symbol is upper case (J). However, when an SI unit is spelled out in English, it should always begin with a lower case letter ( joule )\u2014except in a situation where any word in that position would be capitalized, such as at the beginning of a sentence or in material using title case . Note that \"degree Celsius \" conforms to this rule because the \"d\" is lowercase.\u2014\u00a0Based on The International System of Units , section 5.2. Confusion with newton metre [ edit ] Main article: newton metre In mechanics , the concept of force (in some direction) has a close analog in the concept of torque (about some angle): Linear Angular force torque mass moment of inertia distance angle A result of this similarity is that the SI unit for torque is the newton metre , which works out algebraically to have the same dimensions as the joule. But they are not interchangeable. The CGPM has given the unit of energy the name joule , but has not given the unit of torque any special name, hence it is simply the newton metre (N\u22c5m) \u2013 a compound name derived from its constituent parts. [5] The use of newton metres for torque and joules for energy is helpful to avoid misunderstandings and miscommunications. [5] The distinction may be seen also in the fact that energy is a scalar \u2013 the dot product of a vector force and a vector displacement. By contrast, torque is a vector \u2013 the cross product of a distance vector and a force vector. Torque and energy are related to one another by the equation E = \u03c4 \u03b8 , {\\displaystyle E=\\tau \\theta \\ ,} where E is energy, \u03c4 is (the vector magnitude of) torque, and \u03b8 is the angle swept (in radians ). Since radians are dimensionless, it follows that torque and energy have the same dimensions. Practical examples [ edit ] One joule in everyday life represents approximately: The energy required to lift a medium-size tomato (100\u00a0g) 1\u00a0m vertically from the surface of the Earth. [6] The energy released when that same tomato falls back down to the ground. The energy required to accelerate a 1\u00a0kg mass at 1 m\u22c5s \u22122 through a distance of 1\u00a0m. The heat required to raise the temperature of 1\u00a0g of water by 0.24\u00a0\u00b0C. [7] The typical energy released as heat by a person at rest every 1/60 s (approximately 17\u00a0ms). [8] The kinetic energy of a 50\u00a0kg human moving very slowly (0.2\u00a0m/s or 0.72\u00a0km/h). The kinetic energy of a 56\u00a0g tennis ball moving at 6\u00a0m/s (22\u00a0km/h). [9] The kinetic energy of an object with mass 1\u00a0kg moving at \u221a 2 \u2248\u00a01.4\u00a0m/s. The amount of electricity required to light a 1\u00a0W LED for 1\u00a0s. Since the joule is also a watt-second and the common unit for electricity sales to homes is the kW\u22c5h (kilowatt-hour), a kW\u22c5h is thus 1000\u00a0W \u00d7 3600\u00a0s = 3.6\u00a0MJ (megajoules).

Picojoule [ edit ] The Picojoule (pJ) is equal to one trillionth (10 \u221212 ) of one joule. Nanojoule [ edit ] The nanojoule (nJ) is equal to one billionth (10 \u22129 ) of one joule. 160 nanojoules is about the kinetic energy of a flying mosquito. [10] Microjoule [ edit ] The microjoule (\u03bcJ) is equal to one millionth (10 \u22126 ) of one joule. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) produces collisions of the microjoule order (7 TeV) per particle. Millijoule [ edit ] The millijoule (mJ) is equal to one thousandth (10 \u22123 ) of a joule. Kilojoule [ edit ] The kilojoule (kJ) is equal to one thousand (10 3 ) joules. Nutritional food labels in most countries express energy in kilojoules (kJ). [11] One square metre of the Earth receives about 1.4 kilojoules of solar radiation every second in full daylight. [12] Megajoule [ edit ] The megajoule (MJ) is equal to one million (10 6 ) joules, or approximately the kinetic energy of a one megagram (tonne) vehicle moving at 161\u00a0km/h. The energy required to heat 10 liters of liquid water at constant pressure from 0\u00a0\u00b0C (32\u00a0\u00b0F) to 100\u00a0\u00b0C (212\u00a0\u00b0F) is approximately 4.2\u00a0MJ. One kilowatt hour of electricity is 3.6 megajoules. Gigajoule [ edit ] The gigajoule (GJ) is equal to one billion (10 9 )\u00a0joules. 6\u00a0GJ is about the chemical energy of combusting 1 barrel (159\u00a0l) of crude oil . [13] 2\u00a0GJ is about the Planck energy unit. Terajoule [ edit ] The terajoule (TJ) is equal to one trillion (10 12 ) joules; or about 0.278 GWh (which is often used in energy tables). About 63 TJ\u2033\u0e3f\u0e3f of energy was released by the atomic bomb that exploded over Hiroshima . [14] The International Space Station , with a mass of approximately 450 megagrams and orbital velocity of 7.7\u00a0km/s, [15] has a kinetic energy of roughly 13 TJ. In 2017 Hurricane Irma was estimated to have a peak wind energy of 112 TJ. [16] [17] Petajoule [ edit ] The petajoule (PJ) is equal to one quadrillion (10 15 ) joules. 210\u00a0PJ is about 50\u00a0megatons of TNT. This is the amount of energy released by the Tsar Bomba , the largest man-made explosion ever. Exajoule [ edit ] The exajoule (EJ) is equal to one quintillion (10 18 ) joules. The 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan had 1.41\u00a0EJ of energy according to its rating of 9.0 on the moment magnitude scale . Yearly U.S. energy consumption amounts to roughly 94\u00a0EJ. Zettajoule [ edit ] The zettajoule (ZJ) is equal to one sextillion (10 21 ) joules. The human annual global energy consumption is approximately 0.5 ZJ. Yottajoule [ edit ] The yottajoule (YJ) is equal to one septillion (10 24 ) joules. This is approximately the amount of energy required to heat all the water on Earth by 1\u00a0\u00b0C. The thermal output of the Sun is approximately 400 YJ per second.

Joule, for example, may formally be written newton metre, or kilogram metre squared per second squared. This, however, is an algebraic freedom to be governed by common sense physical considerations; in a given situation some forms may be more helpful than others. In practice, with certain quantities, preference is given to the use of certain special unit names, or combinations of unit names, to facilitate the distinction between different quantities having the same dimension.

For other uses, see Coming to America (disambiguation) . Coming to America Theatrical release poster illustrated by Drew Struzan Directed by John Landis Produced by George Folsey, Jr. Robert D. Wachs Screenplay by David Sheffield Barry W. Blaustein Story by Eddie Murphy Starring Eddie Murphy Arsenio Hall James Earl Jones John Amos Madge Sinclair Shari Headley Music by Nile Rodgers Cinematography Sol Negrin Woody Omens Edited by Malcolm Campbell George Folsey, Jr. Production company Eddie Murphy Productions Distributed by Paramount Pictures Release date June\u00a029,\u00a01988 ( 1988-06-29 ) Running time 117 minutes Country United States Language English Budget $39 million Box office $288,752,301 [1] Coming to America is a 1988 American romantic comedy film directed by John Landis and based on a story originally created by Eddie Murphy , who also starred in the lead role. The film also co-stars Arsenio Hall , James Earl Jones , Shari Headley , and John Amos . The film was released in the United States on June 29, 1988. Eddie Murphy plays Akeem Joffer, the crown prince of the fictional African nation of Zamunda, who comes to the United States in the hopes of finding a woman he can marry. In 1989, a pilot for a planned spin-off TV show was made, although this was never picked up for a series.

When his parents, King Jaffe and Queen Aeoleon, present him with an arranged bride-to-be , Akeem takes action. Seeking an independent woman who loves him for himself, not his social status , Akeem and his best friend/personal aide, Semmi, travel to the New York City borough of Queens and rent a squalid tenement in the neighborhood of Long Island City under the guise of poor foreign students . Beginning their search for Akeem's bride, they end up invited by some locals to a rally that is raising money for the inner city. During the rally, Akeem encounters Lisa McDowell, who possesses all the qualities he is looking for, and upon his insistence he and Semmi get entry-level jobs working at the local fast food restaurant called McDowell's \u2014 an obvious ripoff of McDonald's \u2014 owned by widower Cleo McDowell, Lisa's father. Akeem's attempts to win Lisa's love are complicated by Lisa's lazy and obnoxious boyfriend, Darryl Jenks ( Eriq La Salle ), whose father owns Soul Glo (a Jheri curl \u2013like hairstyling aid). After Darryl announces their engagement \u2014 without Lisa's consent \u2014 to their families, she starts dating Akeem, who claims that he comes from a family of poor goat herders. Meanwhile, although Akeem thrives on hard work and learning how commoners live, Semmi is not comfortable with living in such meager conditions. After a dinner date with Lisa is thwarted when Semmi furnishes their apartment with a jacuzzi and other luxuries, Akeem confiscates his money and donates it to two homeless men . Semmi wires a telegraph to King Jaffe for more money, prompting Akeem's parents to travel to Queens and expose his identity as a prince. Mr. McDowell, initially disapproving of Akeem as he did not want to see his daughter with a poor man, is ecstatic that he is actually an extremely wealthy prince. Lisa, however, becomes angry and confused that Akeem lied to her about his identity. Akeem explains that he wanted her to love him for who, not what he is, even offering to renounce his throne ; but Lisa, still hurt and angry, refuses to marry him. Despondent, Akeem resigns himself to the arranged marriage, but as they leave, King Jaffe is reprimanded by Queen Aeoleon for clinging to out-dated traditions instead of thinking of his son's happiness. At the wedding procession, a still-heartbroken Akeem waits at the altar as his veiled bride-to-be makes her way down the aisle, but when Akeem lifts the veil to kiss her, he finds Lisa in the wedding gown. Following the ceremony, they ride happily in a carriage to the cheers of Zamundans. Witnessing such splendor, Lisa is both surprised and touched by the fact that Akeem would have given it up just for her. Akeem offers again to abdicate if she doesn't want this life, but Lisa playfully declines. Cast Eddie Murphy as Prince Akeem Joffer, the prince of Zamunda; Randy Watson, a soul singer with the fictional band Sexual Chocolate. [3] Eddie Murphy also plays Saul, the Jewish barbershop customer, as well as Clarence, the owner of the barber shop. [4] [5] Arsenio Hall as Semmi, Akeem's friend; Reverend Brown; [6] Morris the barber; and an unattractive clubgoer. [7] [8] James Earl Jones as King Jaffe Joffer, Akeem's father and King of Zamunda. [9] John Amos as Cleo McDowell, Akeem's employer and Lisa's father. Madge Sinclair as Queen Aeoleon, Akeem's mother and the Queen of Zamunda. Shari Headley as Lisa McDowell, Cleo's oldest daughter and Akeem's love interest . Paul Bates as Oha, a royal servant. Eriq La Salle as Darryl Jenks, Lisa's boyfriend whom she eventually breaks up with. The cast also includes: Frankie Faison [10] as Mr. Townsend, Akeem and Semmi's landlord in Queens; Vanessa Bell as Imani Izzi, Akeem's arranged wife, and Calvin Lockhart as Colonel Izzi, her father; Louie Anderson as Maurice, a McDowell's employee; Allison Dean as Patrice McDowell, Cleo's youngest daughter and Lisa's sister; Samuel L. Jackson as a robber; Vondie Curtis-Hall as the Basketball game vendor; Garcelle Beauvais as a rose bearer; Victoria Dillard as one of Akeem's Zamundan attendants, and Clint Smith as Sweets. Ruben Santiago-Hudson and Cuba Gooding Jr. made their film debuts as a street hustler and a barber shop customer respectively (for the latter, he was credited as Boy Getting Haircut). Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy reprise their roles as, respectively, Mortimer and Randolph Duke from Landis' 1983 Murphy-starring comedy film Trading Places . [11] A segment of the Trading Places score can be heard during their scene. The Dukes' limo driver from that film also cameos as the driver of Akeem and Semmi's limo. [ citation needed ] Coming to America features Murphy and Hall in several different roles, which, following the success of this film, became a Murphy staple. [12] Hall plays Reverend Brown, who introduces Randy Watson (Murphy). [13] Murphy and Hall play elderly barbers Clarence and Morris respectively, who engage in debate with Saul, the old Jewish man (Murphy). Hall also plays a woman (credited as Extremely Ugly Girl) who flirts with Akeem and Semmi. Production Coming to America reunited star Eddie Murphy with director John Landis . The two had previously worked together on the comedy hit Trading Places (1983); however, Landis later recalled the differences in working with Murphy on the two movies: \"The guy on Trading Places was young and full of energy and curious and funny and fresh and great. The guy on Coming to America was the pig of the world... But I still think he's wonderful in the movie.\" [14] \"We had a tussling confrontation\u2026 We didn't come to blows. Personalities didn't mesh. I grabbed him, and he thought I was playing. So he tried to grab my balls and I pushed him away. But I wasn't kidding. He was doing some silly shit that made me mad. He directed me in Trading Places when I was just starting out as a kid, but he was still treating me like a kid five years later during Coming to America . And I hired him to direct the movie! I was gonna direct Coming to America myself, but I knew that Landis had just done three fucked-up pictures in a row and that his career was hanging by a thread after the Twilight Zone trial. I figured the guy was nice to me when I did Trading Places , so I'd give him a shot\u2026 I was going out of my way to help this guy, and he fucked me over. Now he's got a hit picture on his resum\u00e9, a movie that made over $200 million, as opposed to him coming off a couple of fucked-up movies \u2013 which is where I'd rather see him be right now (laughs).\" \u2013 Eddie Murphy [15] Despite the experience, Landis and Murphy collaborated again six years later on Beverly Hills Cop III . South African chorus Ladysmith Black Mambazo sings Mbube during the opening sequence (the song also known as The Lion Sleeps Tonight ). The group has gone on to record several different versions of Mbube; however, the version heard in Coming to America had not been released on its soundtrack or on CD as of 2006. Landis' calling card/easter egg, \" See You Next Wednesday \", appears on a science-fiction movie poster in the subway station after Lisa storms off the train. A promotional song for the film, also titled \" Coming to America \", was written and performed by The System . Release Paramount cancelled press screenings of the film, after initial negative reactions to a press screening in New York. [16] Box office Released on June 29, 1988, by Paramount Pictures in the United States, it was a commercial box-office success, both domestically and worldwide. [17] [18] The film debuted at number one with $21,404,420 from 2,064 screens, for a five-day total of $28,409,497. The film made $128,152,301 in the United States and ended up with a worldwide total of $288,752,301. [19] It was the highest earning film that year for the studio and the third-highest-grossing film at the United States box office. [20] It opened a month later in the UK and earned $7,712,622 during its seven-week run. It opened on September 2 in West Germany, where it debuted at number one with $3,715,791 from 297 screens. It ended its run after 13 weeks with $15,743,447. Reception Coming To America received positive reviews upon release. Review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 68%, based on reviews from 37 critics. [21] Sheila Benson in the Los Angeles Times called it a \"hollow and wearying Eddie Murphy fairy tale\" and bemoans, \"That an Eddie Murphy movie would come to this.\" [22] Vincent Canby in The New York Times was also critical of the writing, calling it a \"possibly funny idea\" but suggesting the screenplay had escaped before it was ready. Canby viewed the film as essentially a romantic comedy but said the romantic elements fell flat, and the film instead goes for broad slapstick . [23] Siskel & Ebert had mixed opinions on the film. Siskel enjoyed the acting from Murphy and Hall but Ebert was disappointed that Murphy did not bring his usual more lively performance, and Ebert was also critical of the unoriginal script. [24] Awards The film was nominated for two Oscars : Best Costume Design by Deborah Nadoolman Landis and Best Makeup by Rick Baker , [25] who designed the makeup effects for both Murphy's and Arsenio Hall's multiple supporting characters. [26] Lawsuit The film was the subject of the Buchwald v. Paramount civil suit, which the humorist Art Buchwald filed in 1990 against the film's producers on the grounds that the film's idea was stolen from his 1982 script treatment about a rich, despotic African potentate who comes to America for a state visit. Paramount had optioned the treatment from Buchwald, and John Landis was attached as director and Eddie Murphy as the lead , but after two years of development hell Paramount abandoned the project in March 1985. In 1987, Paramount began working on Coming to America based on a story by Eddie Murphy. [27] [28] Buchwald won the breach of contract action and the court ordered monetary damages. The parties later settled the case out-of-court prior to an appeal going to trial.

The pilot went unsold, but was televised on July 4, 1989 as part of the CBS Summer Playhouse pilot anthology series. [30] [2] Movie remakes A Tamil movie, My Dear Marthandan , was produced based on the plot of Coming to America . A Hong Kong movie, The Fun, the Luck & the Tycoon , also has the same plot. Influences in music The melody heard in the bathroom scene, where Prince Akeem is being washed by female servants, was sampled in Snoop Dogg 's 2006 song \" That's That \" featuring R. Kelly ; a remix of the song featuring rapper Nas includes a woman's voice saying \"the royal penis is clean your highness\", a line taken from the same scene. Also, the music videos for Busta Rhymes ' 1997 single \" Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could See \" and Action Bronson's 2015 single \" Baby Blue \" are loosely based on the film. The song \"Coming 2 America\" by Ludacris from the album Word of Mouf features samples [31] and lyrics [32] referencing the film. Planned sequel In early 2017, an announcement was publicized which addressed the impending production of a sequel to the film. Kevin Misher was named as producer, and Sheffield and Blaustein , the original screenwriters, were also attached to the project. However, a possible participation of lead actors Eddie Murphy and Arsenio Hall was left undefined. [33] [34] According to several public accounts, Murphy himself apparently posted an announcement regarding the film project a month prior on Facebook, but later claimed that his account had been hacked and completely deleted it.

It runs 2,369 miles (3,813\u00a0km), from Fort Kent, Maine , at the Canada\u2013US border , south to Key West, Florida , making it the longest north\u2013south road in the United States. [2] US\u00a01 is generally paralleled by Interstate 95 (I-95), though the former is significantly farther west (inland) between Jacksonville, Florida , and Petersburg, Virginia . The highway connects most of the major cities of the East Coast\u2014including Miami , Jacksonville, Richmond , Washington, D.C. , Baltimore , Philadelphia , New York City and Boston , passing from the Southeastern United States to New England . While US\u00a01 is generally the easternmost of the main north\u2013south U.S. Highways, parts of US\u00a09 , US\u00a013 , US\u00a015 , US\u00a017 , US\u00a021 , occupy corridors closer to the ocean. In some cases, substantial portions of these routes are east of US\u00a01; US\u00a013 terminates only a couple miles west of US\u00a01 after crossing it in Falls Township, PA , with over 99.5% of it running east of US\u00a01. When the road system was laid out in the 1920s, US\u00a01 was mostly assigned to the existing Atlantic Highway , which followed the Fall Line between the Piedmont and the Atlantic Coastal Plain north of Augusta, Georgia . [3] At the time, the highways farther east were of lower quality and did not serve the major population centers. [4] Construction of the Interstate Highway system gradually changed the use and character of US\u00a01, and I-95 became the major north\u2013south East Coast highway by the late 1960s.

The southernmost piece through the chain islands of the Florida Keys , about 100 miles (160\u00a0km) long, is the two-lane Overseas Highway , originally built in the late 1930s after railroad tycoon Henry Flagler 's Florida East Coast Railway 's Overseas Railroad , which was built 1905-1912 on stone pillars was ruined by the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 . The rest of US\u00a01 in Florida is generally a four-lane divided highway , despite the existence of the newer I-95 not far away. Famous vacation scenic route Florida State Road A1A is a continuous oceanfront alternate to US\u00a01 that runs along the beaches of the Atlantic Ocean , cut only by assorted unbridged inlets and the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral . North of Jacksonville, US\u00a01 turns northwest towards Augusta, Georgia ; US\u00a017 becomes the coastal route into Virginia , where US\u00a013 takes over. [6] In Florida until the 1990s, US\u00a01 used high-contrast markers (white text on a red background). [7] Georgia [ edit ] Downtown Augusta skyline as seen from US\u00a01 in North Augusta near I-520 exit #17 Main article: U.S. Route 1 in Georgia The part of US\u00a01 in Georgia , as it shifts from the coastal alignment in Florida to the Fall Line alignment in South Carolina, is generally very rural, passing through marshes and former plantations between the towns and cities of Folkston , Waycross , Alma , Baxley , Lyons , Swainsboro , and Augusta . The Georgia Department of Transportation has an ongoing plan to widen all of US\u00a01 to four lanes with bypasses which is more than 50 percent complete. The Carolinas [ edit ] I-40 east approaching the Raleigh Beltline, which includes US\u00a01. Main articles: U.S. Route 1 in North and South Carolina In South Carolina , US\u00a01 generally serves mostly rural areas as it falls west of I-95 while the coastal areas are served by routes east of it. Starting in South Carolina, US\u00a01 is paralleled by Interstate 20 along the Fall Line through Aiken , Lexington , and Columbia to Camden and Lugoff . US\u00a01 functions as a local two-lane road with occasional boulevard stretches. After Camden, US\u00a01 continues northeast away from any Interstate towards Bethune , Patrick , McBee and Cheraw with no bypasses or four-lane sections except around Cheraw through the US\u00a052 and SC 9 multiplexes. After SC 9, it continues northward into North Carolina as a two-lane highway. SCDOT has no plans to widen or bypass any US\u00a01 alignments northeast of Camden to the North Carolina line. Between the South Carolina line and the US\u00a074 bypass, US\u00a01 is a two-lane road but sees a considerable amount of truck and tourist traffic of people cutting through from the US\u00a074/ US\u00a0220 and I-73 / I-74 corridor attempting to reach points south and east. US\u00a01 goes through downtown Rockingham , with a bypass in the future plans. North of the NC 177 junction, it becomes four lanes or greater, becoming a super-street with limited access and then becoming a limited access freeway. US\u00a01 becomes a major artery for the state as it moves north of Rockingham. After Richmond County , it goes into Moore County with two expressway bypasses in Southern Pines , Vass and Cameron . US\u00a01 continues with the Jefferson Davis Highway label through Lee County and Sanford , and on to Cary and Raleigh . US\u00a01 runs concurrently with US\u00a064 through most of Cary, where the freeway recently underwent a major renovation and improvements that added lanes in both directions. [8] North of Raleigh, US\u00a01 (known as Capital Boulevard in northern Wake County) crosses Interstate 540 and then again becomes a four-lane divided arterial to Interstate 85 near Henderson . The North Carolina Department of Transportation has begun a corridor study for this section of US\u00a01. [9] Moreover, NCDOT is planning to finish four-laning US\u00a01 in Richmond County past NC 177 with a Rockingham bypass to the east. There are no plans from SCDOT to widen US\u00a01 from the state line. From Henderson into Virginia, US\u00a01 runs parallel with I-85 as a two-lane local road until the state line, where Virginia hosts a continuous third center lane for alternate passing towards US Highway 58 before South Hill . Mid-Atlantic Region [ edit ] The 14th Street Bridge , Washington, D.C. Main articles: U.S. Route 1 in Virginia , District of Columbia , Maryland , Pennsylvania , New Jersey , and New York In the Mid-Atlantic region , US\u00a01 generally serves some of the most populated areas of the east coast . Through Virginia , US\u00a01 is paralleled by Interstates: the remainder of Interstate 85 to Petersburg , Interstate 95 through Richmond and Fredericksburg to Alexandria , and Interstate 395 into Arlington . Within Virginia, US\u00a01 is called Jefferson Davis Highway by state law, although most of the Fairfax County portion, except Lorton , [10] is better known as the Richmond Highway. US\u00a01 crosses the Potomac River with I-395 on the 14th Street Bridges , and splits to follow mainly 14th Street and Rhode Island Avenue through the District of Columbia . US\u00a01 is at the minimum a 3 lane (with alternate passing) from the N.C. line to Petersburg with occasional four lane divided sections. North of Petersburg is a four lane undivided roadway at the minimum to the D.C. line. The route of US\u00a01 from Petersburg to the state line is parallel with the Fall Line . From Petersburg onwards it is parallel with Interstate 95 . After exiting the District into Maryland , US\u00a01 follows the Baltimore-Washington Boulevard, the first of several modern highways built along the Baltimore-Washington corridor; I-95 is the newest, after the Baltimore-Washington Parkway . US\u00a01 runs through the University of Maryland at College Park campus in College Park, Maryland . The route bypasses downtown Baltimore on North Avenue and exits the city to the northeast on Belair Road, gradually leaving the I-95 corridor, which passes through Wilmington, Delaware , for a straighter path towards Philadelphia . Around and beyond Bel Air , US\u00a01 is a two-lane road, crossing the Susquehanna River over the top of the Conowingo Dam before entering Pennsylvania. (Routed further north, U.S. 1 bypasses the state of Delaware , unlike I-95.) [6] Roosevelt Boulevard , Philadelphia, Pennsylvania The two-lane US\u00a01 becomes a four-lane expressway , officially known as the John H. Ware III Memorial Highway, just after crossing into Pennsylvania . This bypass extends around Oxford and Kennett Square , merging into the four-lane divided Baltimore Pike just beyond the latter. At Media , US\u00a01 again becomes a freeway\u00a0\u2013 the Media Bypass\u00a0\u2013 ending just beyond Interstate 476 . After several name changes, the road becomes City Avenue , the western city limits of Philadelphia , at the end of which a short overlap with the Schuylkill Expressway ( I-76 ) leads to the Roosevelt Expressway and then the twelve-lane Roosevelt Boulevard partly overlapping US\u00a013 . US\u00a01 again becomes a freeway after leaving the city, bypassing Penndel and Morrisville and crossing the Delaware River into New Jersey on the Trenton-Morrisville Toll Bridge . [6] The Pulaski Skyway , in Jersey City, Kearny, and Newark, New Jersey After crossing into New Jersey in Mercer County, US\u00a01 continues on the Trenton Freeway through the state capital city of Trenton and Lawrence as a four lane freeway. As the freeway ends, the four lane divided highway upgrades to six lanes after I-95/I-295 passing through the Penns Neck section of West Windsor Township. Through Penns Neck is a series of traffic signals. NJDOT is looking to revamp the highway through this area by replacing traffic signals with grade separations. The highway enters Middlesex County through Plainsboro and South Brunswick, where the highest point resides. [11] By Forrestal Village, the highway downgrades from 6 to 4 lanes until after Finnegans Lane in North Brunswick. Northward, it continues through New Brunswick as a short jersey-freeway until the CR 529/Plainfield Avenue traffic signal in Edison. Through Edison and Woodbridge has a mix of boulevard and jersey freeway segments and continues to do so after the US\u00a09 juncture in the Avenel section of Woodbridge . The US\u00a01/9 concurrency continues through the rest of the state. The six lane divided highway remains through Rahway in Union County and Elizabeth , until it reaches the Newark Airport , where it becomes a dual carriageway freeway around downtown Newark in Essex County with a 2-2-2-2 configuration. The historic Pulaski Skyway takes US\u00a01/9 into Jersey City , and the route exits the freeway at Tonnele Circle to head north into Bergen County . US\u00a01/9 turns onto US\u00a046 as a jersey-freeway, and the three routes run northeast to the George Washington Bridge Plaza , where they merge into I-95 . US\u00a046 ends in the middle of the bridge, which crosses the Hudson River into New York , and US\u00a09 exits just beyond onto Broadway in Manhattan , but US\u00a01 stays with I-95 onto the Cross Bronx Expressway , exiting in the Bronx onto Webster Avenue. Two turns take US\u00a01 via Fordham Road to Boston Road, which it follows northeast out of the city to the state line, never straying far from I-95. As it enters Greenwich, Connecticut, it continues as a two lane local road. New England [ edit ] Main articles: U.S. Route 1 in Connecticut , Rhode Island , Massachusetts , New Hampshire , and Maine In New England , US\u00a01 generally serves large cities in a side street capacity. In Connecticut , US\u00a01 serves the shore of the Long Island Sound parallel to I-95 . Beyond New Haven , the highway travels east\u2013west, and some signs in the state indicate this rather than the standard north\u2013south. While I-95 in Rhode Island takes a diagonal path to Providence , US\u00a01 continues east along the coast through Westerly to Wakefield , where it turns north and follows Narragansett Bay . Most of this part is a four-lane divided highway , providing access to Route 138 towards Newport . After Route 4 splits as a mostly- freeway connection to I-95, US\u00a01 becomes a lower-speed surface road, passing through Warwick , Providence, and Pawtucket . The route parallels I-95 again through Providence and Pawtucket and into Massachusetts , traveling towards Boston as a four-lane road. When it reaches Dedham , US\u00a01 turns east, overlapping I-95 and I-93 east to Braintree and north through Downtown Boston . The Tobin Bridge and Northeast Expressway take US\u00a01 out of Boston, after which it again parallels I-95 through Newburyport to the New Hampshire state line. [6] Former Memorial Bridge between New Hampshire and Maine The monument marking the northern terminus in Fort Kent, ME Monument in Fort Kent dedicated to US Highway 1 The short portion of US\u00a01 in New Hampshire follows the historic Lafayette Road, staying close to I-95 , passing through Portsmouth before crossing the Piscataqua River on the former Memorial Bridge , which was demolished and replaced during 2012\u201313, leaving a temporary gap in US\u00a01. During construction, drivers had to detour to one of two other nearby bridges carrying U.S. Route 1 Bypass or Interstate 95 . Within Maine , US\u00a01 begins as a parallel route to I-95 near the Atlantic Ocean . At Portland , I-95 splits off to the north, and I-295 heads northeast paralleling US\u00a01 to Brunswick . There US\u00a01 turns east as a mostly two-lane road along the coast to Calais ; much of this portion is advertised as the \"Coastal Route\" on signs. North from Calais, US\u00a01 follows the Canada\u2013US border , crossing I-95 in Houlton and eventually turning west and southwest to its \"north\" end at the Clair-Fort Kent Bridge in Fort Kent . The short Route 161 extends north on the New Brunswick (Canada) side of the bridge to Route 120 , a secondary east\u2013west route from Edmundston , New Brunswick west to Quebec Route 289 toward Saint-Alexandre, Quebec . [6] History [ edit ] Marker used for Route 1 in New England (1922) The direct predecessor to US\u00a01 was the Atlantic Highway, an auto trail established in 1911 as the Quebec-Miami International Highway. In 1915 it was renamed the Atlantic Highway, [12] and the northern terminus was changed to Calais, Maine . [13] Due to the overlapping of auto trail designations, portions of the route had other names that remain in common use, such as the Boston Post Road between Boston and New York , the Lincoln Highway between New York and Philadelphia , Baltimore Pike between Philadelphia and Baltimore , and the Dixie Highway in and south of eastern Georgia . North of Augusta, Georgia , the highway generally followed the Eastern U.S. Fall Line , rather than a more easterly route through the swamps of the Atlantic Coastal Plain . [14] Brickell Avenue is the name given to the 2.4 mile stretch of U.S. Route 1 in Miami, Florida just south of the Miami River until the Rickenbacker Causeway . When the New England road marking system was established in 1922, the Atlantic Highway within New England was signed as Route 1 , with a Route 24 continuing north to Madawaska ; [15] New York extended the number to New York City in 1924 with its own Route 1 . [16] Other states adopted their own systems of numbering, and by 1926 all states but Maryland had signed the Atlantic Highway as various routes, usually changing numbers at the state line. In 1925, the Joint Board on Interstate Highways created a preliminary list of interstate routes to be marked by the states, [17] including Route 1 along the Atlantic. This highway began at Fort Kent, Maine and followed the existing Route 24 to Houlton and Route 15 to Bangor , beyond which it generally followed the Atlantic Highway to Miami. [18] In all states but Georgia that had numbered their state highways , Route 1 followed only one or two numbers across the state. [19] The only significant deviation from the Atlantic Highway was between Augusta, Georgia and Jacksonville, Florida , where Route 1 was assigned to a more inland route, rather than following the Atlantic Highway via Savannah . [4] One of the many changes made to the system before the final numbering was adopted in 1926 involved US\u00a01 in Maine. The 1925 plan had assigned Route 1 to the shorter inland route (Route 15) between Houlton and Bangor, while Route 2 followed the longer coastal route via Calais. In the system as adopted in 1926, US\u00a02 instead took the inland route, while US\u00a01 followed the coast, absorbing all of the former Routes 24 and 1 in New England. [20] [21] Many local and regional relocations, often onto parallel superhighways , were made in the early days of US\u00a01; this included the four-lane divided Route 25 in New Jersey , completed in 1932 with the opening of the Pulaski Skyway , [22] and a bypass of Bangor involving the Waldo-Hancock Bridge , opened in 1931. [23] The Overseas Highway from Miami to Key West was completed in 1938, and soon became a southern extension of US\u00a01. [24] The beginning of U.S. 1 as of March 1951. With the construction of the Interstate Highway System in and after the 1950s, much of US\u00a01 from Houlton to Miami was bypassed by Interstate 95 . Between Houlton and Brunswick, Maine , I-95 took a shorter inland route, much of it paralleling US\u00a02 on the alignment proposed for US\u00a01 in 1925. Between Philadelphia and Baltimore , I-95 leaves US\u00a01 to pass through Wilmington . Most notably, I-95 and US\u00a01 follow different corridors between Petersburg, Virginia and Jacksonville, Florida ; while US\u00a01 followed the Fall Line west of the coastal plain, I-95 takes a more direct route through the plain and its swamps. Although some of this part of US\u00a01 was followed by other Interstates\u2014 I-85 between Petersburg and Henderson, North Carolina , and I-20 between Camden, South Carolina and Augusta, Georgia \u2014the rest remains an independent route with four lanes in many places. By the late 1970s, most of I-95 had been completed, replacing US\u00a01 as the main corridor of the east coast and relegating most of it to local road status.

I\u201195 in Houlton Route\u00a0161 at the Fort Kent\u2013Clair Border Crossing in Fort Kent Auxiliary routes [ edit ] US 1 has six three-digit auxiliary routes. In numerical order, these are: US\u00a0201 , from Brunswick, Maine , to the Armstrong\u2013Jackman Border Crossing running south to north in east-central Maine . US\u00a0301 , from Sarasota, Florida , to Glasgow, Delaware , along the Eastern Seaboard . The route closely parallels I-95 for most of its route and has numerous intersections with its parent. US\u00a0401 from Sumter, South Carolina , to Wise, North Carolina , near the Virginia border. For most of the route, it parallels US 1 about 10\u201320 miles (16\u201332\u00a0km) to the east, though the two share pavement in Raleigh, North Carolina . US\u00a0501 from Myrtle Beach, South Carolina , to Buena Vista, Virginia . The highway runs southeast-to-northwest, meeting its parent in Aberdeen and Sanford . US\u00a0601 from Tarboro, South Carolina , to Mount Airy, North Carolina . It runs mostly due south-to-north to the west of US 501, meeting the parent route in Camden, South Carolina . US\u00a0701 from Georgetown, South Carolina , to Four Oaks, North Carolina . Furthest east of the US\u00a01 auxiliary routes, it never meets its parent route, but does intersect US\u00a0501 in Conway, South Carolina , and terminates at US 301 at its northern end. US\u00a0101 , despite its number, is not an auxiliary route, but rather considered a primary U.S. Route in its own right as major highway west of the former US\u00a099 on the west coast of the United States.

(Hidden Alias List Operation) titanium rings stolen from the United States Department of Justice which can display the people listed in the witness protection program . DOJ official William Rose Bailey ( Bruce Willis ) and a protected witness, Alan Caulfield ( Eric Bogosian ) are among those killed. At Caulfield's house in San Bernardino , the Angels track his assassin Randy Emmers ( Rodrigo Santoro ) to a beach where they meet with former Angel Madison Lee ( Demi Moore ). During the Coal Bowl motorcycle race, Emmers targets another witness named Max Petroni ( Shia LaBeouf ), but is killed by the Thin Man ( Crispin Glover ). Inside Emmers' pocket, the Angels discover the photos of Caulfield, Max, and, surprisingly, Dylan, under her birth name, Helen Zaas. Dylan reveals that she is a protected witness after sending her former boyfriend, Irish mob leader Seamus O'Grady ( Justin Theroux ), to prison. O'Grady has since targeted those who wronged him, including Dylan and Max, whose parents O'Grady killed. Max is sent to the home of Bosley's mother ( Ja'net Dubois ) for his protection. At a monastery, the Angels learn about the Thin Man's past from the Mother Superior ( Carrie Fisher ). Afterward, the Angels track O'Grady's mob at San Pedro and manage to get the rings, but O'Grady threatens Dylan with the murder of everyone she loves. While Natalie attends her boyfriend, Peter Kominsky ( Luke Wilson )'s high school reunion at Hermosa Beach and Alex returns home to find her action star boyfriend-under-timeout, Jason Gibbons ( Matt LeBlanc ) telling her awestruck father ( John Cleese ) about her exploits, Dylan leaves the Angels and heads to Mexico . When Natalie, Bosley and Alex notices her letter, they read her reasons for leaving them. While Alex is upset by this, Natalie understands why Dylan led to protect them. When she asks about O'Grady's break out from jail, Charlie reveals someone had him released on good behavior. While in Mexico keeping a low profile, Dylan is convinced to return after seeing an apparition of former Angel Kelly Garrett ( Jaclyn Smith ). Natalie and Alex deduce that Carter is a part of O'Grady's scheme after seeing him return Bosley's keys without any pain, since he had earlier claimed to have broken his ribs, which is now proved to have been a lie. Following him, the two witness him being shot to death by Madison, the true mastermind behind all of this. Though Dylan arrives to back the group, the Angels are shot by Madison, who takes the rings, though they survive by having worn Kevlar vests beforehand. At the base, Charlie through the speakers reprimands Madison for what she's done. He confronts her for endangering the lives of her former teammates. By the time that he had rescued them, the girls were in critical condition and Madison was kicked out of the Angels for it. Madison responds by pulling out her gold guns and shooting the speaker. The Angels realize that Madison, with the protection of O'Grady, is going to sell the rings to the Antonioni Crime Family, the Tanaka Yakuza, and the Diablo Cartel at the Hollywood Walk of Fame , where Jason's film's premiere is about to commence. The Angels set the three groups up to be arrested by the FBI instead, while they confront Madison and O'Grady. The Thin Man comes to the Angels' aid, where it's revealed he's in love with Dylan and is doing his part to protect her. O'Grady kills the Thin Man, but Dylan manages to throw him down to his death. The Angels fight Madison all the way to an abandoned theater, where they kick her to a gas-filling chamber, with her dooming herself by shooting her bullets, exploding it. The Angels attend the premiere where they learn that Mama Bosley is adopting Max. Peter postpones his engagement with Natalie by buying for them a puppy named Spike while Alex terminates her timeout with Jason. The Angels celebrate their victory together with Bosley. Cast [ edit ] Cameron Diaz as Natalie Cook Drew Barrymore as Dylan Sanders Lucy Liu as Alex Munday Bernie Mac as Jimmy Bosley John Forsythe as Charles \"Charlie\" Townsend (Voice) Demi Moore as Madison Lee Justin Theroux as Seamus O'Grady Rodrigo Santoro as Randy Emmers Crispin Glover as the Thin Man Zack Shada as the young Thin Man Shia LaBeouf as Max Petroni Matt LeBlanc as Jason Gibbons Luke Wilson as Peter Kominsky Robert Patrick as U.S. Marshal Ray Carter John Cleese as Mr. Munday Ja'net Dubois as Mama Bosley Jaclyn Smith as Kelly Garrett Bruce Willis as William Rose Bailey Robert Forster as Roger Wixon Eric Bogosian as Alan Caulfield Tommy Flanagan as Irish henchman Cameos [ edit ] Pink as Coal Bowl M.C.

McCarthy previously appeared in the first film as another character, Doris. Shanti Lowry as Treasure Chest dancer Tanoai Reed as Wrestler Guy Oseary as Restaurant patron Jennifer Gimenez as Nun Big Boy (radio host) as Bosley's Cousin Also, a photo of Bill Murray 's version of John Bosley was seen in the Bosley household. Trivia [ edit ] Charlie's Angels: Animated Adventures , an animated prequel series explain how the Angels got there and their mission, concluded by the very introduction of the film. [3] The Seamus O'Grady prison introduction scene is a direct reference to Robert De Niro 's prison-set introduction in Cape Fear . [4] The scene where the Angels go to investigate the body of Agent Caufield dressed as crime-scene professionals is an homage/parody of CSI: Crime Scene Investigation , complete with the theme \" Who Are You \" by The Who . The song \" Feel Good Time \" is the film's main track, and is performed by Pink . Whenever Seamus O'Grady ( Justin Theroux ) appears, he is accompanied by Bernard Hermann 's theme from Cape Fear . The Thin Man character perhaps pays homage to the Thin Man in 1927 German Expressionist film Metropolis , directed by Fritz Lang . In the film, Thin Man is ordered by Joh Frederson, master of Metropolis, to spy on his son Freder. Reception [ edit ] Box office [ edit ] The film had a production budget of $120 million. It grossed $100,830,111 at the United States box office and had to depend on earnings from overseas box office to make profit. By the end of its run, the film had grossed $259,175,788 worldwide, performing worse than its predecessor.

[6] Roger Ebert gave the film \u200b 2 1 \u2044 2 stars out of 4, [7] a higher score than the half star he gave to the first film.

{"question": "where is natural gas found in the us", "answer": "gas; [14]; abundance; be much; than; [13]; describing reserves; surface,", "context": "Natural gas in the United States - Wikipedia Natural gas in the United States From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search Natural Gas production, 1900-2013 Discovered shale gas deposits June 2016 Natural gas in the United States was the nation's largest source of energy production in 2016, representing 33 percent of all energy produced in the U.S. [1] Natural gas has been the largest source of electrical generation in the United States since July 2015. In 2012, the US produced 25.3 trillion cubic feet of marketed natural gas, with an average wellhead value of $2.66 per thousand cubic feet, for a total wellhead value of $67.3 billion. [2] The natural gas industry includes exploration for, production, processing, transportation, storage, and marketing of natural gas and natural gas liquids. [3] The exploration for and production of natural gas and petroleum form a single industry, and many wells produce both oil and gas. The US has been the world's largest producer of natural gas since 2009, when US production surpassed Russia's. In 2013, the US produced 30.0 trillion cubic feet (TCF) of marketed gas. [4] The leading gas-producing area in the United States in 2013 was Texas (7,545 Billion cubic feet (BCF), followed by Pennsylvania (3,259 BCF), and Louisiana (2,407 BCF). [5] US Natural gas production achieved new record highs for each year from 2011 through 2015. Marketed natural gas production in 2015 was 28.8 trillion cubic feet, a 5.4% increase over 2014, and a 52% increase over the production of 18.9 trillion cubic feet per day in 2005. [6] Because of the greater supply, consumer prices for natural gas are significantly lower in the US than in Europe and Japan. [7] The low price of natural gas in the US, together with its smaller carbon footprint compared to coal, has encouraged a rapid growth in electricity generated from natural gas. Between 2005 and 2014, US production of natural gas liquids (NGLs) increased 70%, from 1.74 million barrels per day in 2005 to 2.96 million barrels per day in 2014. The US has been the world's leading producer of natural gas liquids since 2010, when US NGL production passed that of Saudi Arabia. Although the United States leads the world in natural gas production, it is only fifth in proved reserves of natural gas, behind Russia, Iran, Qatar, and Turkmenistan.

Petroleum and natural gas share a common upstream (exploration and production) sector, but the midstream and downstream sectors are largely separate. All large oil companies in the US produce both oil and gas. However, the relative amounts of oil and gas produced vary greatly. Of the top ten natural gas-producing companies in the US 2009, only three (BP, ConocoPhiillips, and XTO) were also among the top ten oil producers. Top natural gas producers in the United States, 2009 Rank Company Billion cubic ft./Year 1 BP 907 2 XTO Energy 855 3 ConocoPhillips 850 4 Chesapeake Energy 835 5 Anadarko Petroleum 817 6 Devon Energy 743 7 Encana 590 8 Exxon Mobil 566 9 Williams Companies 435 10 EOG Resources 422 Annual owned production, 2009. Source: [8] In 2009, the production owned by the top ten companies was 31% of total US natural gas production. [8] Natural gas exploration [ edit ] In 2010, the industry drilled and completed 16,696 wells primarily for gas, slightly more than the number of wells drilled primarily for oil (15,753). Many wells produced both oil and gas, and oil wells produced 18 percent of US gas production in 2013. Of the gas wells, 1,105 were exploratory wells, and 15,591 development wells. [9] The number of actively drilling gas rigs was once regarded as a reliable leading indicator of near-future gas production. However, the average number of active gas drill rigs has fallen each year for four straight years from 2010 (942 rigs) to 2014 (332 rigs), a drop of 65 percent, even while gas production rose each year for the same period, from 21.3 trillion cubic feet (TCF) in 2010 to 25.7 TCF in 2014, an increase of 21 percent. Remaining proved reserves increased overall, from 301 TCF in 2013 to 338 TCF in 2013 (the last year for which reserves are available), an increase of 11 percent. The rise in gas production despite fewer rigs drilling has been explained by the greater efficiency in drilling, and the greater productivity of shale gas wells. [10] Natural gas production [ edit ] Top producing gas fields in the United States, 2013 Rank Field State Discovery Year Billion cubic ft./Year 1 Marcellus natural gas trend Pennsylvania and West Virginia 2008 2,836 2 Newark East Barnett Shale Texas 1981 1,952 3 Haynesville Shale Louisiana and Texas 2008 1,426 4 Eagle Ford Formation Texas 1962 1,112 5 Fayetteville Shale Arkansas 2005 1,025 6 San Juan Basin New Mexico and Colorado 1927 1,025 7 Carthage Texas 1936 653 8 Pinedale Gas Field Wyoming 1955 568 9 Sprayberry Texas 1949 307 10 Wattenberg Gas Field Colorado 1970 305 Annual production 2013. Source: [11] Most oil fields produce some gas, and vice versa, but the ratio of oil and gas varies considerably. Some gas fields, such as coalbed methane wells, and some other gas fields, called \"dry gas\" fields, produce only gas. Of the top ten gas-producing fields in the US, only one, the Eagle Ford trend, is also among the top ten oil fields. Coalbed methane [ edit ] Main article: Coalbed methane in the United States Coalbed methane production in the US peaked at 1.97 BCF in 2008, when it made up 7.8 percent of US gas production. By 2013, coalbed methane production had declined to 1.47 BCF. [12] Shale gas [ edit ] Main article: Shale gas in the United States Since 2000, shale gas has become a key source of natural gas in the US. Production rose sixfold from 2007 to 2013, when shale gas contributed 11.4 TCF, 38 percent of US gas production, and was still increasing. [12] Gas prices [ edit ] Main article: Natural gas price Price per million BTU of oil and natural gas in the US, 1998-2015 The most commonly quoted producer price for natural gas is the Louisiana-based Henry Hub price, which is futures-traded on NYMEX . A barrel of oil releases about 5.8 million BTU when burned, so that 5.8 MCF of gas (at the standard one thousand BTU per cubic foot) releases about the same energy as a barrel of oil. Sometimes gas containing 5.8 million BTU is defined as a \" barrel of oil equivalent for energy calculation purposes. [13] When describing reserves or production, however, the oil and gas industry more commonly uses the rounded number of 6 MCF of gas (or 6 million BTU in the natural gas) as equal to one barrel of oil equivalent. [14] Since the price of natural gas was deregulated in the 1990s, its price has tended to parallel that of oil, with oil usually at a premium on a BTU basis. But starting in the late 2000s, an abundance of natural gas in North America has caused the price of a unit of energy from gas to be much lower than the price of energy from oil. Natural gas pipelines [ edit ] Natural gas pipelines map Main article: Natural gas pipeline system in the United States When oil and natural gas are brought to the surface, they are usually separated at the wellhead, after which the oil and the gas are treated separately. Gas flows through a gathering system into a pipeline to a gas processing plant. As of 2014, there were 189,000 miles of interstate natural gas pipelines in the United States [15] Gas processing [ edit ] Natural gas processing plants in the US, 2009 (US Energy Information Administration) Disposition of total US natural gas produced (gross withdrawals) in 2014. Data from US EIA Main article: Natural-gas processing Natural gas has a variety of chemical constituents that must be removed or diluted with other gas to achieve consistent pipeline quality. Pipeline gas specifications vary from line to line, but generally the gas must contain no appreciable hydrogen sulfide (which is toxic), less than a few percent carbon dioxide (carbon dioxide reacts with water to form carbonic acid, which is corrosive to iron and steel pipe), and a British thermal unit (BTU) content of 900 or more. Natural gas delivered to consumers generally has a BTU content of about 1020 to 1050 per standard cubic foot, slightly higher than that of pure methane (1010 BTU). [16] Natural gas liquids [ edit ] Natural gas is composed primarily of methane, but often contains longer-chain hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbon compounds from hexane (each molecule of which is a simple chain containing six carbon atoms, hence called C6) and heavier generally separate out (\"condense\") from the gas at the wellhead; this mixture is called condensate , and is usually reported as oil production, and sold to refineries the same as oil. The C2 through C5 hydrocarbons ( ethane , propane , butane , and pentane) are known as natural gas liquids (NGLs), and remain in gaseous form until they are extracted at a gas processing plant. [17] The division between the two classes is not perfect: some hexane, and heptane remain in the gas to be separated out as NGLs, while some butane and pentane, may separate out with the condensate. Natural gas which contains NGLs is called \"wet gas.\" Gas which naturally contains no NGLs, or gas from which the NGLs have been removed, is called \"dry gas.\" Natural gas liquids are used either for fuel (sold as propane, or liquid petroleum gas (LPG), or for feedstock to the petrochemical industry . The United States has been the world's top producer of NGLs since 2010, and is far above second place Saudi Arabia, which produced 1.82 million barrels per day in 2015. Increased production of NGLs since 2000 has lowered the price of NGLs in the North American market, leading to a surge in construction and expansion of petrochemical plants to convert ethane and propane into ethylene and propylene, which are used to make plastics. [18] The United States has the world's largest ethylene-manufacturing capacity, 28.4 million tons per year in 2015, with projects to add another 7.6 million tons from 2015 through 2017. [19] As of 2015, the reduction in NGL prices had turned North America from one of the high-cost places to manufacture petrochemical, into the lowest-cost area outside the Middle East. [20] Other byproducts [ edit ] Main article: Helium production in the United States Main article: Sulfur production in the United States Some natural gas contains enough helium to be extracted as a byproduct. Sulfur , which must be removed from natural gas for safety, aesthetic, and environmental reasons, is recovered and sold as a byproduct. In 2013, natural gas processing plants recovered 1.02 million metric tons of sulfur, which was 12 percent of US supply of elemental sulfur (the remaining sulfur production came from oil refineries). [21] Gas storage [ edit ] US natural gas storage and consumption in trillion cubic feet. Data from US EIA. Source. [22] Main article: Natural gas storage Consumption of natural gas in the US is strongly seasonal, higher in the winter than the summer by between 50% to 90%, depending on severity of the winter. To make larger volumes of gas available in the winter, companies have established underground gas storage facilities. There are three types of natural gas storage units currently in service in the US: salt domes, depleted gas reservoirs, and deep aquifers. [23] The largest volume held in storage was 8.29 trillion cubic feet in October 2012. This was equivalent to 26 percent of the total US production in 2014. The small mid-summer increase shown on the consumption graph is due to increased gas use for electrical power in the summer. Unlike residential, commercial, and industrial use, all of which are higher in winter, electrical power generation uses more gas in the summer. Natural gas marketing [ edit ] From the processing plant, natural gas is sold mostly to gas utility companies. In 2014, 46% of the marketed gas was used by commercial and industrial users, 33% by electrical power generators, and 21% by residential consumers. [24] Natural gas electricity generation [ edit ] Main article: Natural gas power plant Since 2009, electricity generation has been the largest use of natural gas in the US. Electricity generated by natural gas has been by far the fastest-growing source of electricity in the US since the 1990s. Natural gas became the second-largest source of US electricity in 2006, when it surpassed nuclear power. In late 2015, natural gas surpassed coal as the largest source of electricity generated in the United States. In the decade 2005 to 2015, electricity generated by natural gas increased by 574 billion kilowatt-hours, more than triple the increase of the second-fastest-growing source, wind energy, which increased 173 billion kilowatt-hours over the same period. Natural gas-generated electricity increased its share of total US electricity from 18.8 percent in 2005, to 32.6 percent in 2015. The increase in gas-generated electricity was mostly at the expense of coal power, which fell from 49.6 percent of US electricity in 2005, to 33.2 percent in 2015. Natural gas surpassed coal as the number one generator of US electricity in late 2015. During the 12-month period through August 2016, natural gas generated 34.5 percent of US electricity, versus 29.8 percent for coal. [25] Unlike the other sectors of natural gas consumption, the electrical power industry uses more natural gas in the summer, when electricity demand is increased by air conditioning, and when natural gas prices are at seasonal lows. [26] The increased use of natural gas for electricity is driven by three factors. First, pressure on utilities to decrease greenhouse gas emissions has favored the substitution of coal generation by natural gas generation, which, according to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, [27] and the IPCC, [28] has significantly less life-cycle GHG emissions than coal-powered electricity. Second, gas power plants are able to ramp up and down quickly, making them well suited to complement intermittent power sources such as wind and solar. [29] Third, since late 2008, the price of natural gas has been relatively cheap on the North American market, especially compared to oil. Electricity from oil-powered generators in the US declined 81 percent from 2005 to 2014. The states which use the most natural gas for electricity production are, in descending order, Texas, Florida, California, and New York. Liquified petroleum gas [ edit ] Liquefied petroleum gas includes the butane and propane natural gas liquids removed in gas processing. They are sold for home heating, cooking, and increasingly for motor fuel. The industry segment is represented by the National Propane Gas Association . Vehicle fuel [ edit ] Main article: Natural gas vehicle Natural gas, in the forms of compressed natural gas , liquified natural gas , and liquified petroleum gas , is being increasingly used for motor vehicle fuel, especially in fleet vehicles. It has the advantages over gasoline and diesel fuel of being cheaper and emitting less air pollution. It has the disadvantage of having few retail outlets. As of 2011, 262,000 vehicles in the US ran on natural gas. Although natural gas used for vehicle fuel increased 60 percent in the decade 2004-2014, in 2014 it still made up only 3.7 percent on a BTU-basis of fossil fuel use (gasoline, diesel, and natural gas) as transportation fuel in the US. [30] Transportation fuel made up 0.13 percent of natural gas consumption in 2014. History [ edit ] Main article: History of the petroleum industry in the United States Pipeline technology [ edit ] The natural gas industry in the United States goes back to 1821, when natural gas was discovered and used in Fredonia, New York . From the start, the market for natural gas was limited by pipeline technology. The gas for Fredonia, New York in 1821 was supplied through wooden pipes, which were incapable of carrying gas for long distances. [31] In the 1800s, residences in most cities were supplied with town gas generated from coal at local \" gashouses .\" The gas was carried in cast iron pipes, introduced in 1843, typically with bell-and-spigot joints sealed with rope and molten lead. [32] In the 1800s and early 1900s, most natural gas discoveries were made while exploring for oil. Natural gas was usually an unwanted byproduct of oil production. In the 1870s steel pipe replaced cast iron. In 1883, Pittsburgh became the first major city supplied with natural gas. [33] Other cities followed, but only if they were close to natural gas wells. Because natural gas was a byproduct, it was priced cheaply, and, where available, undercut the market for town gas. In 1891, one of the longest pipelines of the time was built, a 120-mile long pipeline from the gas fields of Indiana to Chicago, without compression. Long-distance high-pressure gas pipelines became feasible after oxyacetylene welding was introduced in 1911, and especially after electric arc welding became popular in the 1920s [31] This allowed remote gas deposits to be supplied to big cities. Natural gas increasingly became a sought-for commodity. Price regulation [ edit ] The prices charged by utilities delivering natural gas to customers have always been subject to state regulation. With the construction of interstate gas pipelines in the 1920s and 1930s, city utilities became dependent on natural gas supplies beyond the regulatory power of state and local governments. In 1935, the federal trade commission, believing that interstate pipelines had too much power to control the downstream gas market, recommended federal controls. Congress passed the Natural Gas Act of 1938 to regulate the rates charged by interstate pipelines. Federal regulations at first included only the rates interstate pipelines charged to carry gas. When the market price of natural gas at the wellhead increased in the 1950s, gas utilities complained that the gas producers should be regulated as well. In 1954, the US Supreme Court ruled in Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Wisconsin that regulation of the wellhead price was within the intent of the Natural Gas Act of 1938 to control prices to utilities, and therefore the federal government could control wellhead prices of any natural gas going into an interstate pipeline. By the early 1970s, the artificially low price set by the federal government had created a shortage, but only of interstate gas. Gas consumed within the state where it was produced was plentiful, but more expensive. By 1975, about half the natural gas produced went to the intrastate market. In 1975 and 1976, some schools and factories in the Midwest shut down periodically when the local utility could not find any natural gas to buy at the controlled price. The Federal Power Commission tried to allocate the scarce gas by identifying \"high-priority\" and \"low-priority\" customers, but this caused extensive litigation. The federal government responded to gas shortages with the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, which both increased federal regulation by extended price controls to all existing natural gas wells, and promised to end price controls on all new wells by 1985. [34] Under the new rules, natural gas was subject to a complicated set of prices, depending on when the well was drilled, the size of the company that owned the well, the permeability of the formation, and the distance of the well from previous wells. Gas production from some types of gas reservoirs received tax subsidies. In 1976, the federal government established the Eastern Gas Shales Project, a large research effort to find ways to produce gas from shale. Price controls grew even more complex with the Energy Act of 1980, which exempted Devonian gas shales (shales deposited during the Devonian geologic period ) from price controls (but not gas shales deposited during other geologic periods), as well as low-permeability formations and coalbed methane. In addition, production from these sources earned tax credits for the producers for qualified wells drilled before January 1, 1992; the tax credits expired at the end of 2002. [35] The Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act of 1989 mandated that all remaining price controls on natural gas were to be eliminated as of January 1, 1993. Shortages and surplus [ edit ] Hubbert's 1962 peak gas prediction (black) versus actual US lower-48 state gas production (red) Main article: Peak gas As with petroleum, the future supply of natural gas has long been the subject of concern, and predictions of shortages. In 1952, Dr. Edward Steidle, Dean of the School of Mineral Industries at Pennsylvania State College , predicted that gas production would soon decline significantly from 1952 rates, so that gas would cease to be a significant energy source by 2002, and possibly as early as 1975. [36] In 1956, M King Hubbert used an estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) of 850\u00a0trillion cubic feet (24,000\u00a0km 3 ) (an amount postulated by geologist Wallace Pratt ) to predict a US production peak of about 14\u00a0trillion cubic feet (400\u00a0km 3 ) per year to occur \"approximately 1970\". [37] Pratt, in his EUR estimate (p.\u00a096), explicitly included what he called the \"phenomenal discovery rate\" that the industry was then experiencing in the offshore Gulf of Mexico. [38] US marketed gas production reached a peak in 1973 at about 22.6\u00a0trillion cubic feet (640\u00a0km 3 ), and declined to a low of 16.9\u00a0trillion cubic feet (480\u00a0km 3 ) in 1986. But then instead of declining further, as predicted by the Hubbert curve, natural gas production rose slowly but steadily for the next 15 years, and reached 20.6 TCF in 2001. Then it dropped again for a few years, and in 2005 was down to 18.9 TCF. After 2005, natural gas production rose rapidly, exceeded its old 1973 peak, and set new records for high production in each year 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, when marketed production was 28.8\u00a0trillion cubic feet (820\u00a0km 3 ). [39] International trade [ edit ] Comparison of natural gas prices in Japan, United Kingdom, and United States, 2007-2011 Net annual natural gas imports (imports minus exports) to the United States, 1975-2013. Data from US Energy Information Administration website. United States monthly net exports (exports minus imports) of liquified natural gas, 2007-2016. Data from US EIA Natural gas depends on pipelines for economical transport. Without pipeline connections, natural gas must be transported as liquefied natural gas (LNG), an expensive process. For this reason, the price of natural gas tends to differ between regions not connected by gas pipelines. The North American market, consisting of Canada, Mexico, and the United States, all connected by a common pipeline network, has had much lower gas prices in recent years than some other major world gas markets, such as Europe (since 2010), Japan (since 2008), and Korea. The United States is connected by pipeline to Canada and Mexico. The US has long imported large quantities of gas from Canada, and exported smaller quantities to some parts of eastern Canada. In 2014, the US imported 2,634 BCF from Canada, and exported 769 BCF, so that net imports from Canada totaled 1,865 BCF. The United States has exported increasing volumes to Mexico over the past decade. In 2014, the US exported 728.5 BCF to Mexico, and imported 1.4 BCF, so that net exports to Mexico totaled 727 BCF. The cost of net imports peaked at US$29.7 billion in 2005; the cost of net imports was $5.9 billion in 2014. Liquified natural gas [ edit ] Proposed LNG Export Terminals in the US, 2012 (US Energy Information Administration) Main article: Liquified natural gas In past years, when experts were projecting gas shortages in North America, utility companies built liquified natural gas (LNG) import terminals along the coast. Net imports of LNG peaked in 2007, but have since decreased. In 2014, the US imported 59 BCF of LNG gas, and exported 16 BCF, so that net LNG imports amounted to 43 BCF. Most imported LNG was from Trinidad and Tobago . Long-term LNG contracts usually tie the price of LNG to the oil price. In 2010, after the price of US natural gas fell below that of world markets, US companies have proposed establishing a number of LNG export terminals. A number of these proposals involve converting inactive LNG import terminals to handle LNG exports. Any proposals to export natural gas must be approved by the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which gives its approval only if the project receives a satisfactory environmental review, and if FERC finds that the export terminal would be in the public interest. [40] As of August 2015, 24 new LNG export terminals have been proposed, of which FERC has so far approved 6. [41] Cheniere Energy expects to begin exporting LNG through its Sabine Pass terminal in January 2016. [42] As of 2014, the only active LNG export terminal in the US was in Kenai, Alaska. The plant, with a capacity of 0.2 BCF per day, is owned by ConocoPhillips, and has been exporting LNG since 1969. [43] [44] Most exported LNG went to Japan. The New England States are connected by pipeline to the rest of the US and to Canada, but the existing pipelines are insufficient to supply the winter demand. For this reason, a quarter of New England's demand for gas is supplied by more-expensive LNG. Four LNG import terminals serve New England, but most LNG imported to New England arrives through the Everett terminal in Boston, and the Canaport terminal in New Brunswick, Canada. [45] As of 2015, pipelines were under construction to carry cheaper gas from Pennsylvania to New England.

[1] [2] [3] Until this point, the Indian Constituent Assembly had served as an interim legislature. See the 'Durations' section below to find the time-range associated with these elections. The Indian National Congress (INC) won a landslide victory, winning 364 of the 489 seats and 45% of the total votes polled. This was over four times as many votes as the second-largest party. Jawaharlal Nehru became the first democratically elected Prime Minister of the country. In the first Lok Sabha polls held in 1951, India had around 173 million voters, out of an overall population of about 360 million. [4] Voter turnout was 45.7%.

While Shyama Prasad Mookerjee went on to found the Jana Sangh in October 1951, Dalit leader Dr. B. R. Ambedkar revived the Scheduled Castes Federation (which was later named the Republican Party ). Other parties which started coming to the forefront included the Kisan Mazdoor Praja Parishad , whose prime mover was Acharya Kripalani ; the Socialist Party , which had Ram Manohar Lohia and Jayaprakash Narayan 's leadership to boast of; and the Communist Party of India . However, these smaller parties were unable to make an electoral stand against the Indian National Congress. Constituencies [ edit ] The first general elections, which were conducted for 489 seats in 401 constituencies, represented 25 Indian states. At that time, there were 314 constituencies with one seat, 86 with two seats and one with three seats. [6] The multi-seat constituencies were abolished in the 1960s.

Acharya Kripalani lost from Faizabad in UP as KMPP candidate, but his wife Sucheta Kripalani defeated the Congress candidate Manmohini Sahgal in Delhi. [8] Government formation [ edit ] The Speaker of the first Lok Sabha was Ganesh Vasudev Mavalankar . The first Lok Sabha also witnessed 677 sittings (3,784 hours), the highest recorded count of the number of sittings. The Lok Sabha lasted its full term from 17 April 1952 until 4 April 1957. Duration [ edit ] While Indian Government's official websites and official documents assign the year 1951 to these polls, it is a misrepresentation because all territories except Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir voted in February\u2013March 1952; no polls were held for Lok Sabha seats in Kashmir until 1967, and only Himachal Pradesh voted in 1951 for the first Lok Sabha because weather tends to be inclement in February and March, heavy snow impending free movement. [9] The rest of the India voted only in February\u2013March 1952 for the Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections. Polling was held between 25 October 1951 and 27 March 1952. The very first votes of the election were cast in the tehsil (district) of Chini in Himachal Pradesh.

It lies within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets , separated from the eastern edge of the square mile of the City of London by the open space known as Tower Hill . It was founded towards the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest of England . The White Tower , which gives the entire castle its name, was built by William the Conqueror in 1078 and was a resented symbol of oppression, inflicted upon London by the new ruling elite. The castle was used as a prison from 1100 ( Ranulf Flambard ) until 1952 ( Kray twins ), [3] although that was not its primary purpose. A grand palace early in its history, it served as a royal residence. As a whole, the Tower is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a moat . There were several phases of expansion, mainly under Kings Richard I , Henry III , and Edward I in the 12th and 13th\u00a0centuries. The general layout established by the late 13th\u00a0century remains despite later activity on the site. The Tower of London has played a prominent role in English history. It was besieged several times, and controlling it has been important to controlling the country. The Tower has served variously as an armoury , a treasury , a menagerie , the home of the Royal Mint , a public record office , and the home of the Crown Jewels of England . From the early 14th\u00a0century until the reign of Charles II , a procession would be led from the Tower to Westminster Abbey on the coronation of a monarch. In the absence of the monarch, the Constable of the Tower is in charge of the castle. This was a powerful and trusted position in the medieval period. In the late 15th century, the castle was the prison of the Princes in the Tower . Under the Tudors , the Tower became used less as a royal residence, and despite attempts to refortify and repair the castle, its defences lagged behind developments to deal with artillery. The peak period of the castle's use as a prison was the 16th and 17th\u00a0centuries, when many figures who had fallen into disgrace, such as Elizabeth I before she became queen, Sir Walter Raleigh , and Elizabeth Throckmorton , were held within its walls. This use has led to the phrase \" sent to the Tower \". Despite its enduring reputation as a place of torture and death, popularised by 16th-century religious propagandists and 19th-century writers, only seven people were executed within the Tower before the World Wars of the 20th\u00a0century. Executions were more commonly held on the notorious Tower Hill to the north of the castle, with 112 occurring there over a 400-year period. In the latter half of the 19th century, institutions such as the Royal Mint moved out of the castle to other locations, leaving many buildings empty. Anthony Salvin and John Taylor took the opportunity to restore the Tower to what was felt to be its medieval appearance, clearing out many of the vacant post-medieval structures. In the First and Second World Wars, the Tower was again used as a prison and witnessed the executions of 12\u00a0men for espionage. After the Second World War, damage caused during the Blitz was repaired, and the castle reopened to the public. Today, the Tower of London is one of the country's most popular tourist attractions. Under the ceremonial charge of the Constable of the Tower, it is cared for by the charity Historic Royal Palaces and is protected as a World Heritage Site .

[4] It would have visually dominated the surrounding area and stood out to traffic on the River Thames. [5] The castle is made up of three \" wards \", or enclosures. The innermost ward contains the White Tower and is the earliest phase of the castle. Encircling it to the north, east, and west is the inner ward, built during the reign of Richard I (1189\u20131199). Finally, there is the outer ward which encompasses the castle and was built under Edward I . Although there were several phases of expansion after William the Conqueror founded the Tower of London, the general layout has remained the same since Edward\u00a0I completed his rebuild in 1285. The castle encloses an area of almost 12 acres (4.9 hectares) with a further 6 acres (2.4\u00a0ha) around the Tower of London constituting the Tower Liberties \u2013 land under the direct influence of the castle and cleared for military reasons. [6] The precursor of the Liberties was laid out in the 13th\u00a0century when Henry III ordered that a strip of land adjacent to the castle be kept clear. [7] Despite popular fiction, the Tower of London never had a permanent torture chamber, although the basement of the White Tower housed a rack in later periods. [8] Tower Wharf was built on the bank of the Thames under Edward I and was expanded to its current size during the reign of Richard II (1377\u20131399). [9] White Tower [ edit ] Main article: White Tower (Tower of London) The White Tower is a keep (also known as a donjon ), which was often the strongest structure in a medieval castle, and contained lodgings suitable for the lord\u00a0\u2013 in this case, the king or his representative. [10] According to military historian Allen Brown, \"The great tower [White Tower] was also, by virtue of its strength, majesty and lordly accommodation, the donjon par excellence \". [11] As one of the largest keeps in the Christian world , [12] the White Tower has been described as \"the most complete eleventh-century palace in Europe\". [13] The original entrance to the White Tower was at first-floor level The White Tower, not including its projecting corner towers, measures 36 by 32 metres (118 by 105\u00a0ft) at the base, and is 27\u00a0m (90\u00a0ft) high at the southern battlements. The structure was originally three storeys high, comprising a basement floor, an entrance level, and an upper floor. The entrance, as is usual in Norman keeps, was above ground, in this case on the south face, and accessed via a wooden staircase which could be removed in the event of an attack. It was probably during Henry II 's reign (1154\u20131189) that a forebuilding was added to the south side of the tower to provide extra defences to the entrance, but it has not survived. Each floor was divided into three chambers, the largest in the west, a smaller room in the north-east, and the chapel taking up the entrance and upper floors of the south-east. [14] At the western corners of the building are square towers, while to the north-east a round tower houses a spiral staircase. At the south-east corner there is a larger semi-circular projection which accommodates the apse of the chapel. As the building was intended to be a comfortable residence as well as a stronghold, latrines were built into the walls, and four fireplaces provided warmth. [13] The main building material is Kentish rag-stone , although some local mudstone was also used. Caen stone was imported from northern France to provide details in the Tower's facing, although little of the original material survives as it was replaced with Portland stone in the 17th\u00a0and 18th\u00a0centuries. As most of the Tower's windows were enlarged in the 18th\u00a0century, only two original\u00a0\u2013 albeit restored\u00a0\u2013 examples remain, in the south wall at the gallery level. [15] The tower was terraced into the side of a mound, so the northern side of the basement is partially below ground level. [16] As was typical of most keeps, [17] the bottom floor was an undercroft used for storage. One of the rooms contained a well. Although the layout has remained the same since the tower's construction, the interior of the basement dates mostly from the 18th\u00a0century when the floor was lowered and the pre-existing timber vaults were replaced with brick counterparts. [16] The basement is lit through small slits. [13] St John's Chapel, inside the White Tower The entrance floor was probably intended for the use of the Constable of the Tower , Lieutenant of the Tower of London and other important officials. The south entrance was blocked during the 17th\u00a0century, and not reopened until 1973. Those heading to the upper floor had to pass through a smaller chamber to the east, also connected to the entrance floor. The crypt of St\u00a0John's Chapel occupied the south-east corner and was accessible only from the eastern chamber. There is a recess in the north wall of the crypt; according to Geoffrey Parnell, Keeper of the Tower History at the Royal Armouries, \"the windowless form and restricted access, suggest that it was designed as a strong-room for safekeeping of royal treasures and important documents\". [16] The upper floor contained a grand hall in the west and residential chamber in the east\u00a0\u2013 both originally open to the roof and surrounded by a gallery built into the wall\u00a0\u2013 and St\u00a0John's Chapel in the south-east. The top floor was added in the 15th\u00a0century, along with the present roof. [14] [18] St\u00a0John's Chapel was not part of the White Tower's original design, as the apsidal projection was built after the basement walls. [16] Due to changes in function and design since the tower's construction, except for the chapel little is left of the original interior. [19] The chapel's current bare and unadorned appearance is reminiscent of how it would have been in the Norman period. In the 13th century, during Henry III's reign, the chapel was decorated with such ornamentation as a gold-painted cross, and stained glass windows that depicted the Virgin Mary and the Holy Trinity . [20] Innermost ward [ edit ] The innermost ward encloses an area immediately south of the White Tower, stretching to what was once the edge of the River Thames. As was the case at other castles, such as the 11th-century Hen Domen , the innermost ward was probably filled with timber buildings from the Tower's foundation. Exactly when the royal lodgings began to encroach from the White Tower into the innermost ward is uncertain, although it had happened by the 1170s. [15] The lodgings were renovated and elaborated during the 1220s and 1230s, becoming comparable with other palatial residences such as Windsor Castle . [21] Construction of Wakefield and Lanthorn Towers\u00a0\u2013 located at the corners of the innermost ward's wall along the river\u00a0\u2013 began around 1220. [22] [nb 1] They probably served as private residences for the queen and king respectively. The earliest evidence for how the royal chambers were decorated comes from Henry III's reign: the queen's chamber was whitewashed, and painted with flowers and imitation stonework. A great hall existed in the south of the ward, between the two towers. [23] It was similar to, although slightly smaller than, that also built by Henry III at Winchester Castle . [24] Near Wakefield Tower was a postern gate which allowed private access to the king's apartments. The innermost ward was originally surrounded by a protective ditch, which had been filled in by the 1220s. Around this time, a kitchen was built in the ward. [25] Between 1666 and 1676, the innermost ward was transformed and the palace buildings removed. [26] The area around the White Tower was cleared so that anyone approaching would have to cross open ground. The Jewel House was demolished, and the Crown Jewels moved to Martin Tower. [27] Interior of the innermost ward. Right of centre is the 11th-century White Tower; the structure at the end of the walkway to the left is Wakefield Tower. Beyond that can be seen Traitors' Gate. Inner Ward [ edit ] See also: Church of St Peter ad Vincula The inner ward was created during Richard the Lionheart's reign, when a moat was dug to the west of the innermost ward, effectively doubling the castle's size. [28] [29] Henry\u00a0III created the ward's east and north walls, and the ward's dimensions remain to this day. [7] Most of Henry's work survives, and only two of the nine towers he constructed have been completely rebuilt. [30] Between the Wakefield and Lanthorn Towers, the innermost ward's wall also serves as a curtain wall for the inner ward. [31] The main entrance to the inner ward would have been through a gatehouse , most likely in the west wall on the site of what is now Beauchamp Tower. The inner ward's western curtain wall was rebuilt by Edward\u00a0I. [32] The 13th-century Beauchamp Tower marks the first large-scale use of brick as a building material in Britain, since the 5th-century departure of the Romans. [33] The Beauchamp Tower is one of 13\u00a0towers that stud the curtain wall. Clockwise from the south-west corner they are: Bell, Beauchamp, Devereux, Flint, Bowyer, Brick, Martin, Constable, Broad Arrow, Salt, Lanthorn, Wakefield, and the Bloody Tower. [31] While these towers provided positions from which flanking fire could be deployed against a potential enemy, they also contained accommodation. As its name suggests, Bell Tower housed a belfry, its purpose to raise the alarm in the event of an attack. The royal bow-maker, responsible for making longbows , crossbows , catapults , and other siege and hand weapons, had a workshop in the Bowyer Tower. A turret at the top of Lanthorn Tower was used as a beacon by traffic approaching the Tower at night. [34] The south face of the Waterloo Block As a result of Henry's expansion, St\u00a0Peter ad Vincula , a Norman chapel which had previously stood outside the Tower, was incorporated into the castle. Henry decorated the chapel by adding glazed windows, and stalls for himself and his queen. [30] It was rebuilt by Edward\u00a0I at a cost of over \u00a3300 [35] and again by Henry VIII in 1519; the current building dates from this period, although the chapel was refurbished in the 19th\u00a0century. [36] Immediately west of Wakefield Tower, the Bloody Tower was built at the same time as the inner ward's curtain wall, and as a water-gate provided access to the castle from the River Thames. It was a simple structure, protected by a portcullis and gate. [37] The Bloody Tower acquired its name in the 16th\u00a0century, as it was believed to be the site of the murder of the Princes in the Tower . [38] Between 1339 and 1341, a gatehouse was built into the curtain wall between Bell and Salt Towers. [39] During the Tudor period, a range of buildings for the storage of munitions was built along the inside of the north inner ward. [40] The castle buildings were remodelled during the Stuart period , mostly under the auspices of the Office of Ordnance. In 1663 just over \u00a34,000 was spent building a new storehouse (now known as the New Armouries) in the inner ward. [41] Construction of the Grand Storehouse north of the White Tower began in 1688, on the same site as the dilapidated Tudor range of storehouses; [42] it was destroyed by fire in 1841. The Waterloo Block, a former barracks in the castellated Gothic Revival style with Domestic Tudor details, [43] was built on the site and remains to this day, housing the Crown Jewels on the ground floor. [44] Outer Ward [ edit ] A third ward was created during Edward\u00a0I's extension to the Tower, as the narrow enclosure completely surrounded the castle. At the same time a bastion known as Legge's Mount was built at the castle's north-west corner. Brass Mount, the bastion in the north-east corner, was a later addition. The three rectangular towers along the east wall 15 metres (49\u00a0ft) apart were dismantled in 1843. Although the bastions have often been ascribed to the Tudor period, there is no evidence to support this; archaeological investigations suggest that Legge's Mount dates from the reign of Edward I. [45] Blocked battlements (also known as crenellations) in the south side of Legge's Mount are the only surviving medieval battlements at the Tower of London (the rest are Victorian replacements). [46] A new 50-metre (160\u00a0ft) moat was dug beyond the castle's new limits; [47] it was originally 4.5 metres (15\u00a0ft) deeper in the middle than it is today. [45] With the addition of a new curtain wall, the old main entrance to the Tower of London was obscured and made redundant; a new entrance was created in the south-west corner of the external wall circuit. The complex consisted of an inner and an outer gatehouse and a barbican , [48] which became known as the Lion Tower as it was associated with the animals as part of the Royal Menagerie since at least the 1330s. [49] The Lion Tower itself no longer survives. [48] Edward extended the south side of the Tower of London onto land that had previously been submerged by the River Thames. In this wall, he built St\u00a0Thomas's Tower between 1275 and 1279; later known as Traitors' Gate , it replaced the Bloody Tower as the castle's water-gate. The building is unique in England, and the closest parallel is the now demolished water-gate at the Louvre in Paris. The dock was covered with arrowslits in case of an attack on the castle from the River; there was also a portcullis at the entrance to control who entered. There were luxurious lodgings on the first floor. [50] Edward also moved the Royal Mint into the Tower; its exact location early on is unknown, although it was probably in either the outer ward or the Lion Tower. [51] By 1560, the Mint was located in a building in the outer ward near Salt Tower. [52] Between 1348 and 1355, a second water-gate, Cradle Tower, was added east of St\u00a0Thomas's Tower for the king's private use. [39] The Tower of London's outer curtain wall, with the curtain wall of the inner ward just visible behind. In the centre is Legge's Mount. Foundation and early history [ edit ] Victorious at the Battle of Hastings on 14 October 1066, the invading Duke of Normandy , William the Conqueror , spent the rest of the year securing his holdings, by fortifying key positions. He founded several castles along the way, but took a circuitous route toward London; [53] [54] only when he reached Canterbury did he turn towards England's largest city. As the fortified bridge into London was held by Saxon troops, he decided instead to ravage Southwark before continuing his journey around southern England. [55] A series of Norman victories along the route cut the city's supply lines and in December 1066, isolated and intimidated, its leaders yielded London without a fight. [56] [57] Between 1066 and 1087, William established 36\u00a0castles, [54] although references in the Domesday Book indicate that many more were founded by his subordinates. [58] The new ruling elite undertook what has been described as \"the most extensive and concentrated programme of castle-building in the whole history of feudal Europe\". [59] They were multi-purpose buildings, serving as fortifications (used as a base of operations in enemy territory), centres of administration, and residences. [60] William sent an advance party to prepare the city for his entrance, to celebrate his victory and found a castle; in the words of William's biographer, William of Poitiers , \"certain fortifications were completed in the city against the restlessness of the huge and brutal populace. For he [William] realised that it was of the first importance to overawe the Londoners\". [53] At the time, London was the largest town in England; the foundation of Westminster Abbey and the old Palace of Westminster under Edward the Confessor had marked it as a centre of governance, and with a prosperous port it was important for the Normans to establish control over the settlement. [57] The other two castles in London\u00a0\u2013 Baynard's Castle and Montfichet's Castle \u2013 were established at the same time. [61] The fortification that would later become known as the Tower of London was built onto the south-east corner of the Roman town walls, using them as prefabricated defences, with the River Thames providing additional protection from the south. [53] This earliest phase of the castle would have been enclosed by a ditch and defended by a timber palisade , and probably had accommodation suitable for William. [62] The White Tower dates from the late 11th\u00a0century. Most of the early Norman castles were built from timber, but by the end of the 11th\u00a0century a few, including the Tower of London, had been renovated or replaced with stone. [61] Work on the White Tower\u00a0\u2013 which gives the whole castle its name\u00a0\u2013 [12] is usually considered to have begun in 1078, however the exact date is uncertain. William made Gundulf , Bishop of Rochester , responsible for its construction, although it may not have been completed until after William's death in 1087. [12] The White Tower is the earliest stone keep in England, and was the strongest point of the early castle. It also contained grand accommodation for the king. [63] At the latest, it was probably finished by 1100 when Bishop Ranulf Flambard was imprisoned there. [19] [nb 2] Flambard was loathed by the English for exacting harsh taxes. Although he is the first recorded prisoner held in the Tower, he was also the first person to escape from it, using a smuggled rope secreted in a butt of wine. He was held in luxury and permitted servants, but on 2 February 1101 he hosted a banquet for his captors. After plying them with drink, when no one was looking he lowered himself from a secluded chamber, and out of the Tower. The escape came as such a surprise that one contemporary chronicler accused the bishop of witchcraft. [65] The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that in 1097 King William II ordered a wall to be built around the Tower of London; it was probably built from stone as a replacement for the timber palisade that arced around the north and west sides of the castle, between the Roman wall and the Thames. [66] The Norman Conquest of London manifested itself not only with a new ruling class, but in the way the city was structured. Land was confiscated and redistributed amongst the Normans, who also brought over hundreds of Jews, for financial reasons. [67] The Jews arrived under the direct protection of the Crown, as a result of which Jewish communities were often found close to castles. [68] The Jews used the Tower as a retreat, when threatened by anti-Jewish violence. [67] The death in 1135 of Henry I left England with a disputed succession; although the king had persuaded his most powerful barons to swear support for the Empress Matilda , just a few days after Henry's death Stephen of Blois arrived from France to lay claim to the throne. The importance of the city and its Tower is marked by the speed at which he secured London. The castle, which had not been used as a royal residence for some time, was usually left in the charge of a Constable , a post held at this time by Geoffrey de Mandeville . As the Tower was considered an impregnable fortress in a strategically important position, possession was highly valued. Mandeville exploited this, selling his allegiance to Matilda after Stephen was captured in 1141 at the Battle of Lincoln . Once her support waned, the following year he resold his loyalty to Stephen. Through his role as Constable of the Tower, Mandeville became \"the richest and most powerful man in England\". [69] When he tried the same ploy again, this time holding secret talks with Matilda, Stephen had him arrested, forced him to cede control of his castles, and replaced him with one of his most loyal supporters. Until then the position had been hereditary, originally held by Geoffrey de Mandeville (a friend of William the Conqueror's and ancestor of the Geoffrey that Stephen and Matilda dealt with), but the position's authority was such that from then on it remained in the hands of an appointee of the monarch. The position was usually given to someone of great importance, who might not always be at the castle due to other duties. Although the Constable was still responsible for maintaining the castle and its garrison, from an early stage he had a subordinate to help with this duty: the Lieutenant of the Tower. [69] Constables also had civic duties relating to the city. Usually they were given control of the city and were responsible for levying taxes, enforcing the law and maintaining order. The creation in 1191 of the position of Lord Mayor of London removed many of the Constable's civic powers, and at times led to friction between the two. [70] Expansion [ edit ] The castle probably retained its form as established by 1100 until the reign of Richard I (1189\u20131199). [71] The castle was extended under William Longchamp , King Richard's Lord Chancellor and the man in charge of England while he was on crusade. The Pipe Rolls record \u00a32,881 1s 10d spent at the Tower of London between 3 December 1189 and 11 November 1190, [72] from an estimated \u00a37,000 spent by Richard on castle building in England. [73] According to the contemporary chronicler Roger of Howden , Longchamp dug a moat around the castle and tried in vain to fill it from the Thames. [28] Longchamp was also Constable of the Tower, and undertook its expansion while preparing for war with King Richard's younger brother, Prince John , who in Richard's absence arrived in England to try to seize power. As Longchamp's main fortress, he made the Tower as strong as possible. The new fortifications were first tested in October 1191, when the Tower was besieged for the first time in its history. Longchamp capitulated to John after just three days, deciding he had more to gain from surrender than prolonging the siege. [74] The Tower of London from The Shard . The River Thames is to the south. The outer curtain walls were erected in the 13th\u00a0century. John succeeded Richard as king in 1199, but his rule proved unpopular with many of his barons , who in response moved against him. In 1214, while the king was at Windsor Castle, Robert Fitzwalter led an army into London and laid siege to the Tower. Although under-garrisoned, the Tower resisted and the siege was lifted once John signed the Magna Carta . [75] The king reneged on his promises of reform, leading to the outbreak of the First Barons' War . Even after the Magna Carta was signed, Fitzwalter maintained his control of London. During the war, the Tower's garrison joined forces with the barons. John was deposed in 1216 and the barons offered the English throne to Prince Louis , the eldest son of the French king. However, after John's death in October 1216, many began to support the claim of his eldest son, Henry III. War continued between the factions supporting Louis and Henry, with Fitzwalter supporting Louis. Fitzwalter was still in control of London and the Tower, both of which held out until it was clear that Henry III's supporters would prevail. [75] In the 13th\u00a0century, Kings Henry III (1216\u20131272) and Edward I (1272\u20131307) extended the castle, essentially creating it as it stands today. [22] Henry was disconnected from his barons, and a mutual lack of understanding led to unrest and resentment towards his rule. As a result, he was eager to ensure the Tower of London was a formidable fortification; at the same time Henry was an aesthete and wished to make the castle a comfortable place to live. [76] From 1216 to 1227 nearly \u00a310,000 was spent on the Tower of London; in this period, only the work at Windsor Castle cost more (\u00a315,000). Most of the work was focused on the palatial buildings of the innermost ward. [21] The tradition of whitewashing the White Tower (from which it derives its name) began in 1240. [77] Beginning around 1238, the castle was expanded to the east, north, and north-west. The work lasted through the reign of Henry\u00a0III and into that of Edward\u00a0I, interrupted occasionally by civil unrest. New creations included a new defensive perimeter, studded with towers, while on the west, north, and east sides, where the wall was not defended by the river, a defensive ditch was dug. The eastern extension took the castle beyond the bounds of the old Roman settlement, marked by the city wall which had been incorporated into the castle's defences. [77] The Tower had long been a symbol of oppression, despised by Londoners, and Henry's building programme was unpopular. So when the gatehouse collapsed in 1240, the locals celebrated the setback. [78] The expansion caused disruption locally and \u00a3166 was paid to St Katherine's Hospital and the prior of Holy Trinity in compensation. [79] Henry III often held court at the Tower of London, and held parliament there on at least two occasions (1236 and 1261) when he felt that the barons were becoming dangerously unruly. In 1258, the discontented barons, led by Simon de Montfort , forced the King to agree to reforms including the holding of regular parliaments. Relinquishing the Tower of London was among the conditions. Henry\u00a0III resented losing power and sought permission from the pope to break his oath. With the backing of mercenaries, Henry installed himself in the Tower in 1261. While negotiations continued with the barons, the King ensconced himself in the castle, although no army moved to take it. A truce was agreed with the condition that the King hand over control of the Tower once again. Henry won a significant victory at the Battle of Evesham in 1265, allowing him to regain control of the country and the Tower of London. Cardinal Ottobuon came to England to excommunicate those who were still rebellious; the act was deeply unpopular and the situation was exacerbated when the cardinal was granted custody of the Tower. Gilbert de Clare, 6th Earl of Hertford , marched on London in April 1267 and laid siege to the castle, declaring that custody of the Tower was \"not a post to be trusted in the hands of a foreigner, much less of an ecclesiastic\". [80] Despite a large army and siege engines, Gilbert de Clare was unable to take the castle. The Earl retreated, allowing the King control of the capital, and the Tower experienced peace for the rest of Henry's reign. [81] Although he was rarely in London, Edward I undertook an expensive remodelling of the Tower, costing \u00a321,000 between 1275 and 1285, over double that spent on the castle during the whole of Henry III's reign. [82] Edward\u00a0I was a seasoned castle builder, and used his experience of siege warfare during the crusades to bring innovations to castle building. [82] His programme of castle building in Wales heralded the introduction of the widespread use of arrowslits in castle walls across Europe, drawing on Eastern influences. [83] At the Tower of London, Edward filled in the moat dug by Henry III and built a new curtain wall along its line, creating a new enclosure. A new moat was created in front of the new curtain wall. The western part of Henry III's curtain wall was rebuilt, with Beauchamp Tower replacing the castle's old gatehouse. A new entrance was created, with elaborate defences including two gatehouses and a barbican . [84] In an effort to make the castle self-sufficient, Edward\u00a0I also added two watermills . [85] Six hundred Jews were imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1278, charged with coin clipping . [67] Persecution of the country's Jewish population under Edward began in 1276 and culminated in 1290 when he issued the Edict of Expulsion , forcing the Jews out of the country. [86] Later Medieval Period [ edit ] A model of the Tower of London as it appeared after the final period of expansion under Edward\u00a0I During Edward II 's reign (1307\u20131327) there was relatively little activity at the Tower of London. [87] However, it was during this period that the Privy Wardrobe was founded. The institution was based at the Tower and responsible for organising the state's arms. [88] In 1321, Margaret de Clare, Baroness Badlesmere became the first woman imprisoned in the Tower of London after she refused Queen Isabella admittance to Leeds Castle [89] and ordered her archers to fire upon Isabella, killing six of the royal escort. [90] [91] [92] Generally reserved for high-ranking inmates, the Tower was the most important royal prison in the country. [93] However it was not necessarily very secure, and throughout its history people bribed the guards to help them escape. In 1323 Roger Mortimer, Baron Mortimer , was aided in his escape from the Tower by the Sub-Lieutenant of the Tower who let Mortimer's men inside. They hacked a hole in his cell wall and Mortimer escaped to a waiting boat. He fled to France where he encountered Edward's Queen. They began an affair and plotted to overthrow the King. One of Mortimer's first acts on entering England in 1326 was to capture the Tower and release the prisoners held there. For four years he ruled while Edward III was too young to do so himself; in 1330, Edward and his supporters captured Mortimer and threw him in the Tower. [94] Under Edward III's rule (1312\u20131377) England experienced renewed success in warfare after his father's reign had put the realm on the backfoot against the Scots and French. Amongst Edward's successes were the battles of Cr\u00e9cy and Poitiers where King John II of France was taken prisoner, and the capture of the King David II of Scotland at Neville's Cross . During this period, the Tower of London held many noble prisoners of war. [95] Edward\u00a0II had allowed the Tower of London to fall into a state of disrepair, [39] and by the reign of Edward III the castle was an uncomfortable place. The nobility held captive within its walls were unable to engage in activities such as hunting which were permissible at other royal castles used as prisons, for instance Windsor. Edward III ordered that the castle should be renovated. [96] One of the powerful French magnates held in the Tower during the Hundred Years' War was Charles, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans , the nephew of the King of France. This late 15th-century image is the earliest surviving non-schematic picture of the Tower of London. It shows the White Tower and the water-gate, with Old London Bridge in the background. [97] When Richard II was crowned in 1377, he led a procession from the Tower to Westminster Abbey . This tradition began in at least the early 14th century and lasted until 1660. [95] During the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 the Tower of London was besieged with the King inside. When Richard rode out to meet with Wat Tyler , the rebel leader, a crowd broke into the castle without meeting resistance and looted the Jewel House . The Archbishop of Canterbury , Simon Sudbury , took refuge in St\u00a0John's Chapel, hoping the mob would respect the sanctuary. However, he was taken away and beheaded on Tower Hill. [98] Six years later there was again civil unrest, and Richard spent Christmas in the security of the Tower rather than Windsor as was more usual. [99] When Henry Bolingbroke returned from exile in 1399, Richard was imprisoned in the White Tower. He abdicated and was replaced on the throne by Bolingbroke, who became King Henry IV. [98] In the 15th century, there was little building work at the Tower of London, yet the castle still remained important as a place of refuge. When supporters of the late Richard II attempted a coup , Henry\u00a0IV found safety in the Tower of London. During this period, the castle also held many distinguished prisoners. The heir to the Scottish throne, later King James I of Scotland , was kidnapped while journeying to France in 1406 and held in the Tower. The reign of Henry V (1413\u20131422) renewed England's fortune in the Hundred Years' War against France. As a result of Henry's victories, such as the Battle of Agincourt , many high-status prisoners were held in the Tower of London until they were ransomed. [100] Much of the latter half of the 15th century was occupied by the Wars of the Roses between the claimants to the throne, the houses of Lancaster and York . [101] The castle was once again besieged in 1460, this time by a Yorkist force. The Tower was damaged by artillery fire but only surrendered when Henry VI was captured at the Battle of Northampton . With the help of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick (nicknamed \"the Kingmaker\") Henry recaptured the throne for a short time in 1470. However, Edward IV soon regained control and Henry VI was imprisoned in the Tower of London, where he was probably murdered. [98] During the wars, the Tower was fortified to withstand gunfire, and provided with loopholes for cannons and handguns: an enclosure was created for this purpose to the south of Tower Hill, although it no longer survives. [101] The Two Princes Edward and Richard in the Tower, 1483 by Sir John Everett Millais , 1878 Shortly after the death of Edward\u00a0IV in 1483, the notorious murder of the Princes in the Tower is traditionally believed to have taken place. The incident is one of the most infamous events associated with the Tower of London. [102] Edward V 's uncle Richard, Duke of Gloucester was declared Lord Protector while the prince was too young to rule. [103] Traditional accounts have held that the 12-year-old Edward was confined to the Tower of London along with his younger brother Richard . The Duke of Gloucester was proclaimed King Richard III in June. The princes were last seen in public in June 1483; [102] it has traditionally been thought that the most likely reason for their disappearance is that they were murdered late in the summer of 1483. [103] Bones thought to belong to them were discovered in 1674 when the 12th-century forebuilding at the entrance to the White Tower was demolished; however, the reputed level at which the bones were found (10\u00a0ft or 3\u00a0m) would put the bones at a depth similar to that of the recently discovered Roman graveyard found 12\u00a0ft (4\u00a0m) underneath the Minories a few hundred yards to the north. [104] Opposition to Richard escalated until he was defeated at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485 by the Lancastrian Henry Tudor , who ascended to the throne as Henry VII. [102] Changing use [ edit ] The beginning of the Tudor period marked the start of the decline of the Tower of London's use as a royal residence. As 16th-century chronicler Raphael Holinshed said the Tower became used more as \"an armouries and house of munition, and thereunto a place for the safekeeping of offenders than a palace roiall for a king or queen to sojourne in\". [97] The Yeoman Warders have been the Royal Bodyguard since at least 1509. [105] During the reign of Henry VIII , the Tower was assessed as needing considerable work on its defences. In 1532, Thomas Cromwell spent \u00a33,593 on repairs and imported nearly 3,000\u00a0tons of Caen stone for the work. [36] Even so, this was not sufficient to bring the castle up to the standard of contemporary military fortifications which were designed to withstand powerful artillery. [106] Although the defences were repaired, the palace buildings were left in a state of neglect after Henry's death. Their condition was so poor that they were virtually uninhabitable. [97] From 1547 onwards, the Tower of London was only used as a royal residence when its political and historic symbolism was considered useful, for instance each of Edward VI , Mary I , and Elizabeth I briefly stayed at the Tower before their coronations. [107] In the 16th\u00a0century, the Tower acquired an enduring reputation as a grim, forbidding prison. This had not always been the case. As a royal castle, it was used by the monarch to imprison people for various reasons, however these were usually high-status individuals for short periods rather than common citizenry as there were plenty of prisons elsewhere for such people. Contrary to the popular image of the Tower, prisoners were able to make their life easier by purchasing amenities such as better food or tapestries through the Lieutenant of the Tower. [108] As holding prisoners was originally an incidental role of the Tower\u00a0\u2013 as would have been the case for any castle\u00a0\u2013 there was no purpose-built accommodation for prisoners until 1687 when a brick shed, a \"Prison for Soldiers\", was built to the north-west of the White Tower. The Tower's reputation for torture and imprisonment derives largely from 16th-century religious propagandists and 19th-century romanticists. [109] Although much of the Tower's reputation is exaggerated, the 16th and 17th\u00a0centuries marked the castle's zenith as a prison, with many religious and political undesirables locked away. [109] The Privy Council had to sanction the use of torture, so it was not often used; between 1540 and 1640, the peak of imprisonment at the Tower, there were 48\u00a0recorded cases of the use of torture. The three most common forms used were the infamous rack , the Scavenger's daughter , and manacles. [110] The rack was introduced to England in 1447 by the Duke of Exeter, the Constable of the Tower; consequentially it was also known as the Duke of Exeter's daughter . [111] One of those tortured at the Tower was Guy Fawkes , who was brought there on 6 November 1605; after torture he signed a full confession to the Gunpowder Plot . [109] Among those held and executed at the Tower was Anne Boleyn . [109] Although the Yeoman Warders were once the Royal Bodyguard, by the 16th and 17th\u00a0centuries their main duty had become to look after the prisoners. [112] The Tower was often a safer place than other prisons in London such as the Fleet , where disease was rife. High-status prisoners could live in conditions comparable to those they might expect outside; one such example was that while Walter Raleigh was held in the Tower his rooms were altered to accommodate his family, including his son who was born there in 1605. [110] Executions were usually carried out on Tower Hill rather than in the Tower of London itself, and 112\u00a0people were executed on the hill over 400\u00a0years. [113] Before the 20th\u00a0century, there had been seven executions within the castle on Tower Green ; as was the case with Lady Jane Grey , this was reserved for prisoners for whom public execution was considered dangerous. [113] After Lady Jane Grey's execution on 12 February 1554, [114] Queen Mary I imprisoned her sister Elizabeth, later Queen Elizabeth I, in the Tower under suspicion of causing rebellion as Sir Thomas Wyatt had led a revolt against Mary in Elizabeth's name. [115] The cobbled surface of Tower Hill to the north of the Tower of London. Over a period of 400\u00a0years, 112\u00a0people were executed on the hill. [113] The Office of Ordnance and Armoury Office were founded in the 15th\u00a0century, taking over the Privy Wardrobe's duties of looking after the monarch's arsenal and valuables. [116] As there was no standing army before 1661, the importance of the royal armoury at the Tower of London was that it provided a professional basis for procuring supplies and equipment in times of war. The two bodies were resident at the Tower from at least 1454, and by the 16th\u00a0century they had moved to a position in the inner ward. [117] The Board of Ordnance (successor to these Offices) had its headquarters in the White Tower and used surrounding buildings for storage. In 1855 the Board was abolished; its successor (the Military Store Department of the War Office ) was also based there until 1869, after which its headquarters staff were relocated to the Royal Arsenal in Woolwich (where the recently closed Woolwich Dockyard was converted into a vast ordnance store). [118] Political tensions between Charles I and Parliament in the second quarter of the 17th\u00a0century led to an attempt by forces loyal to the King to secure the Tower and its valuable contents, including money and munitions. London's Trained Bands , a militia force, were moved into the castle in 1640. Plans for defence were drawn up and gun platforms were built, readying the Tower for war. The preparations were never put to the test. In 1642, Charles I attempted to arrest five members of parliament. When this failed he fled the city, and Parliament retaliated by removing Sir John Byron , the Lieutenant of the Tower. The Trained Bands had switched sides, and now supported Parliament; together with the London citizenry, they blockaded the Tower. With permission from the King, Byron relinquished control of the Tower. Parliament replaced Byron with a man of their own choosing, Sir John Conyers . By the time the English Civil War broke out in November 1642, the Tower of London was already in Parliament's control. [119] The last monarch to uphold the tradition of taking a procession from the Tower to Westminster to be crowned was Charles II in 1661. At the time, the castle's accommodation was in such poor condition that he did not stay there the night before his coronation. [120] Under the Stuart kings the Tower's buildings were remodelled, mostly under the auspices of the Office of Ordnance. Just over \u00a34,000 was spent in 1663 on building a new storehouse, now known as the New Armouries in the inner ward. [41] In the 17th\u00a0century there were plans to enhance the Tower's defences in the style of the trace italienne , however they were never acted on. Although the facilities for the garrison were improved with the addition of the first purpose-built quarters for soldiers (the \"Irish Barracks\") in 1670, the general accommodations were still in poor condition. [121] An engraving of the Tower of London in 1737 by Samuel and Nathaniel Buck When the Hanoverian dynasty ascended the throne, their situation was uncertain and with a possible Scottish rebellion in mind, the Tower of London was repaired. Gun platforms added under the Stuarts had decayed. The number of guns at the Tower was reduced from 118 to 45, and one contemporary commentator noted that the castle \"would not hold out four and twenty hours against an army prepared for a siege\". [122] For the most part, the 18th-century work on the defences was spasmodic and piecemeal, although a new gateway in the southern curtain wall permitting access from the wharf to the outer ward was added in 1774. The moat surrounding the castle had become silted over the centuries since it was created despite attempts at clearing it. It was still an integral part of the castle's defences, so in 1830 the Constable of the Tower, the Duke of Wellington , ordered a large-scale clearance of several feet of silt. However this did not prevent an outbreak of disease in the garrison in 1841 caused by poor water supply, resulting in several deaths. To prevent the festering ditch posing further health problems, it was ordered that the moat should be drained and filled with earth. The work began in 1843 and was mostly complete two years later. The construction of the Waterloo Barracks in the inner ward began in 1845, when the Duke of Wellington laid the foundation stone. The building could accommodate 1,000\u00a0men; at the same time, separate quarters for the officers were built to the north-east of the White Tower. The building is now the headquarters of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers . [123] The popularity of the Chartist movement between 1828 and 1858 led to a desire to refortify the Tower of London in the event of civil unrest. It was the last major programme of fortification at the castle. Most of the surviving installations for the use of artillery and firearms date from this period. [124] During the First World War, eleven men were tried in private and shot by firing squad at the Tower for espionage. [125] During the Second World War, the Tower was once again used to hold prisoners of war. One such person was Rudolf Hess , Adolf Hitler 's deputy, albeit just for four days in 1941. He was the last state prisoner to be held at the castle. [126] The last person to be executed at the Tower was German spy Josef Jakobs who was shot on 15 August 1941. [127] The executions for espionage during the wars took place in a prefabricated miniature rifle range which stood in the outer ward and was demolished in 1969. [128] The Second World War also saw the last use of the Tower as a fortification. In the event of a German invasion , the Tower, together with the Royal Mint and nearby warehouses, was to have formed one of three \"keeps\" or complexes of defended buildings which formed the last-ditch defences of the capital. [129] Restoration and tourism [ edit ] A recreation of Edward I 's bedchamber in the river-side St\u00a0Thomas's Tower above Traitors' Gate . [130] The Tower of London has become established as one of the most popular tourist attractions in the country. It has been a tourist attraction since at least the Elizabethan period, when it was one of the sights of London that foreign visitors wrote about. Its most popular attractions were the Royal Menagerie and displays of armour. The Crown Jewels also garner much interest, and have been on public display since 1669. The Tower steadily gained popularity with tourists through the 19th\u00a0century, despite the opposition of the Duke of Wellington to visitors. Numbers became so high that by 1851 a purpose-built ticket office was erected. By the end of the century, over 500,000 were visiting the castle every year. [131] Over the 18th and 19th\u00a0centuries, the palatial buildings were slowly adapted for other uses and demolished. Only the Wakefield and St\u00a0Thomas's Towers survived. [120] The 18th\u00a0century marked an increasing interest in England's medieval past. One of the effects was the emergence of Gothic Revival architecture . In the Tower's architecture, this was manifest when the New Horse Armoury was built in 1825 against the south face of the White Tower. It featured elements of Gothic Revival architecture such as battlements. Other buildings were remodelled to match the style and the Waterloo Barracks were described as \"castellated Gothic of the 15th\u00a0century\". [132] [133] Between 1845 and 1885 institutions such as the Mint which had inhabited the castle for centuries moved to other sites; many of the post-medieval structures left vacant were demolished. In 1855, the War Office took over responsibility for manufacture and storage of weapons from the Ordnance Office, which was gradually phased out of the castle. At the same time, there was greater interest in the history of the Tower of London. [132] Public interest was partly fuelled by contemporary writers, of whom the work of William Harrison Ainsworth was particularly influential. In The Tower of London: A Historical Romance he created a vivid image of underground torture chambers and devices for extracting confessions that stuck in the public imagination. [109] Harrison also played another role in the Tower's history, as he suggested that Beauchamp Tower should be opened to the public so they could see the inscriptions of 16th- and 17th-century prisoners. Working on the suggestion, Anthony Salvin refurbished the tower and led a further programme for a comprehensive restoration at the behest of Prince Albert . Salvin was succeeded in the work by John Taylor . When a feature did not meet his expectations of medieval architecture Taylor would ruthlessly remove it; as a result, several important buildings within the castle were pulled down and in some cases post-medieval internal decoration removed. [134] The main entrance to the Tower of London. Today the castle is a popular tourist attraction. Although only one bomb fell on the Tower of London in the First World War (it landed harmlessly in the moat), the Second World War left a greater mark. On 23 September 1940, during the Blitz , high-explosive bombs damaged the castle, destroying several buildings and narrowly missing the White Tower. After the war, the damage was repaired and the Tower of London was reopened to the public. [135] In 1974, there was a bomb explosion in the Mortar Room in the White Tower, leaving one person dead and 35 injured. No one claimed responsibility for the blast, but the police investigated suspicions that the IRA was behind it. [136] In the 21st\u00a0century, tourism is the Tower's primary role, the remaining routine military activities, under the Royal Logistic Corps , having wound down in the latter half of the 20th century and moved out of the castle. [135] However, the Tower is still home to the ceremonial regimental headquarters of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers , and the museum dedicated to it and its predecessor, the Royal Fusiliers . [137] [138] Also, a detachment of the unit providing the Queen's Guard at Buckingham Palace still mounts a guard at the Tower, and with the Yeomen Warders , takes part in the Ceremony of the Keys each day. [139] [140] [141] On several occasions through the year gun salutes are fired from the Tower by the Honourable Artillery Company , these consist of 62 rounds for royal occasions, and 41 on other occasions. [142] Two of the ravens Since 1990, the Tower of London has been cared for by an independent charity, Historic Royal Palaces , which receives no funding from the Government or the Crown. [143] In 1988, the Tower of London was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites , in recognition of its global importance and to help conserve and protect the site. [144] [145] However, recent developments, such as the construction of skyscrapers nearby, have pushed the Tower towards being added to the United Nations' Heritage in Danger List. [146] The remains of the medieval palace have been open to the public since 2006. Visitors can explore the chambers restored to their former glory, once used by past kings and queens. [147] Although the position of Constable of the Tower remains the highest position held at the Tower, [148] the responsibility of day-to-day administration is delegated to the Resident Governor . [149] At least six ravens are kept at the Tower at all times, in accordance with the belief that if they are absent, the kingdom will fall. [150] They are under the care of the Yeomen Warders . The earliest known reference to a Tower raven is a picture from 1883. [151] As well as having ceremonial duties, the Yeoman Warders provide guided tours around the Tower. [105] [112] Over 2.8 million people visited the Tower of London in 2017. [1] Crown Jewels [ edit ] See also: Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom and Jewel House The Imperial State Crown (side view) The tradition of housing the Crown Jewels in the Tower of London probably dates from the reign of Henry III (1216\u20131272). The Jewel House was built specifically to house the royal regalia, including jewels, plate, and symbols of royalty such as the crown, sceptre, and sword. When money needed to be raised, the treasure could be pawned by the monarch. The treasure allowed the monarch independence from the aristocracy, and consequently was closely guarded. A new position for \"keeper of the jewels, armouries and other things\" was created, [152] which was well rewarded; in the reign of Edward III (1327\u20131377) the holder was paid 12d a day. The position grew to include other duties including purchasing royal jewels, gold, and silver, and appointing royal goldsmiths and jewellers. [152] In 1649, during the English Civil War , the contents of the Jewel House were disposed of along with other royal properties, as decreed by Cromwell. Metal items were sent to the Mint to be melted down and re-used, and the crowns were \"totallie broken and defaced\". [153] When the monarchy was restored in 1660, the only surviving items of the coronation regalia were a 12th-century spoon and three ceremonial swords. (Some pieces that had been sold were later returned to the Crown.) [154] Detailed records of old regalia survived, and replacements were made for the coronation of Charles II in 1661 based on drawings from the time of Charles I. For the coronation of Charles II, gems were rented because the treasury could not afford to replace them. [155] In 1669, the Jewel House was demolished [27] and the Crown Jewels moved into Martin Tower (until 1841). [156] They were displayed here for viewing by the paying public. This was exploited two years later when Colonel Thomas Blood attempted to steal them. [131] Blood and his accomplices bound and gagged the Jewel House keeper. Although they laid their hands on the Imperial State Crown, Sceptre and Orb, they were foiled when the keeper's son turned up unexpectedly and raised the alarm. [153] [157] Since 1994, the Crown Jewels have been on display in the Jewel House in the Waterloo Block. Some of the pieces are used regularly by the Queen. The display includes 23,578 gemstones, the 800-year-old Coronation Spoon, St. Edward's Crown (worn during all crownings at Westminster Abbey) and the Imperial State Crown. [158] [159] [160] Royal Menagerie [ edit ] Wire animal sculptures at the tower, Kendra Haste There is evidence that King John (1166\u20131216) first started keeping wild animals at the Tower. [161] [162] Records of 1210\u20131212 show payments to lion keepers. [163] The Royal Menagerie is frequently referenced during the reign of Henry\u00a0III. Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II presented Henry with three leopards, circa 1235, which were kept in the Tower. [164] In 1251, the sheriffs were ordered to pay fourpence a day towards the upkeep of the King's polar bear, a gift from Haakon IV of Norway in the same year; the bear attracted a great deal of attention from Londoners when it went fishing in the Thames while tied to the land by a chain. [67] [165] [166] In 1254 or 1255, Henry III received an African elephant from Louis IX of France depicted by Matthew Paris in his Chronica Majora . A wooden structure was built to house the elephant, 12.2\u00a0m (40\u00a0ft) long by 6.1\u00a0m (20\u00a0ft) wide. [163] [67] The animal died in 1258, possibly because it was given red wine, but also perhaps because of the cold climate of England. [167] In 1288, Edward I added a lion and a lynx and appointed the first official Keeper of the animals. [168] Edward III added other types of animals, two lions, a leopard and two wildcats. Under subsequent kings, the number of animals grew to include additional cats of various types, jackals, hyenas, and an old brown bear, Max, gifted to Henry VIII by Emperor Maximilian. [169] In 1436, during the time of Henry V, all the lions died and the employment of Keeper William Kerby was terminated. [168] Historical records indicate that a semi-circular structure or barbican was built by Edward I in 1277; this area was later named the Lion Tower, to the immediate west of the Middle Tower. Records from 1335 indicate the purchase of a lock and key for the lions and leopards, also suggesting they were located near the western entrance of the Tower. By the 1500s that area was called the Menagerie. [163] Between 1604 and 1606 the Menagerie was extensive refurbished and an exercise yard was created in the moat area beside the Lion Tower. An overhead platform was added for viewing of the lions by the royals, during lion baiting, for example in the time of James I. Reports from 1657 include mention of six lions, increasing to 11 by 1708, in addition to other types of cats, eagles, owls and a jackal. [163] By the 18th\u00a0century, the menagerie was open to the public; admission cost three half-pence or the supply of a cat or dog to be fed to the lions. By the end of the century, that had increased to 9 pence. [163] [170] A particularly famous inhabitant was Old Martin , a large grizzly bear given to George III by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1811. [171] [172] An 1800 inventory also listed a tiger, leopards, a hyena, a large baboon, various types of monkeys, wolves and \"other animals\". [173] By 1822, however, the collection included only a grizzly bear, an elephant and some birds. Additional animals were then introduced. [174] In 1828 there were over 280 representing at least 60 species as the new keeper Alfred Copps was actively acquiring animals. [175] After the death of George IV in 1830, a decision was made to close down the Menagerie. In 1831, most of the stock was moved to the London Zoo which had opened in 1828. [176] The last of the animals left in 1835, relocated to Regent's Park . This decision was made after an incident, although sources vary as to the specifics: either a lion was accused of biting a soldier, [177] [178] or a sailor, Ensign Seymour, had been bitten by a monkey. [163] [179] The Menagerie buildings were removed in 1852 but the Keeper of the Royal Menagerie was entitled to use the Lion Tower as a house for life. Consequently, even though the animals had long since left the building, the tower was not demolished until the death of Copps, the last keeper, in 1853. [177] In 1999, physical evidence of lion cages was found, one being 3x3 meters (6.5x10 feet) in size, very small for a lion that can grow to be 2.5 meters (approximately 8 feet) long. [180] In 2008, the skulls of two male Barbary lions (now extinct in the wild) from northwest Africa were found in the moat area of the Tower. Radiocarbon tests dated them from 1280\u20131385 and 1420\u20131480. [162] During 2011 an exhibition was hosted at the Tower with fine wire sculptures by Kendra Haste . [181] Ghosts [ edit ] Anne Boleyn was beheaded in 1536 for treason against Henry VIII ; her ghost supposedly haunts the Church of St Peter ad Vincula in the Tower, where she is buried, and has been said to walk around the White Tower carrying her head under her arm. [182] This haunting is commemorated in the 1934 comic song \" With Her Head Tucked Underneath Her Arm \". Other reported ghosts include Henry VI , Lady Jane Grey , Margaret Pole , and the Princes in the Tower . [183] In January 1816, a sentry on guard outside the Jewel House claimed to have witnessed an apparition of a bear advancing towards him, and reportedly died of fright a few days later. [183] In October 1817, a tubular, glowing apparition was claimed to have been seen in the Jewel House by the Keeper of the Crown Jewels , Edmund Lenthal Swifte . He said that the apparition hovered over the shoulder of his wife, leading her to exclaim: \"Oh, Christ! It has seized me!\" Other nameless and formless terrors have been reported, more recently, by night staff at the Tower.

{"question": "what type of fuel goes in a zippo", "answer": "", "context": "Zippo - Wikipedia Zippo From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search For other uses, see Zippo (disambiguation) . Zippo Manufacturing Company Type Private Genre Lighter manufacturer Founded 1932 ; 86\u00a0years ago ( 1932 ) Founder George Grant Blaisdell Headquarters Bradford, Pennsylvania , U.S. Divisions W.R. Case & Sons Cutlery Co. Website zippo.com A Zippo lighter is a reusable metal lighter manufactured by American Zippo Manufacturing Company of Bradford , Pennsylvania, United States of America. [1] Thousands of different styles and designs have been made in the eight decades since their introduction including military versions for specific regiments. Since its invention Zippos have been sold around the world and have been described \"a legendary and distinct symbol of Americana\". [2] [3] In 2012 the company produced the 500-millionth unit. [4] [5] Since its inception Zippo Lighters have been almost exclusively manufactured in the United States, with the exception of those manufactured in Niagara, Canada (an operation that has since been shut down). [6] [7] [8] Contents [ hide ] 1 Company history 2 Usage 2.1 Vietnam War 3 Price 4 Date codes 5 Construction 6 Zippo BLU & Zippo BLU 2 7 Zippo subsidiaries 8 See also 9 References 10 Further reading 11 External links Company history [ edit ] Zippo plant, c. 1930\u20131945 American George G. Blaisdell founded Zippo Manufacturing Company in 1932, and produced the first Zippo lighter in early 1933, being inspired by an Austrian cigarette lighter of similar design made by IMCO. [9] It got its name because Blaisdell liked the sound of the word \"zipper\" and \"zippo\" sounded more modern. [10] On March 3, 1936, a patent was granted for the Zippo lighter. [11] Zippo lighters became popular in the United States military , especially during World War II \u2014when, as the company's web site says, Zippo \"ceased production of lighters for consumer markets and dedicated all manufacturing to the US military\". [12] Period Zippos were made of brass , but Zippo used a black crackle finished steel during the war years because of metal shortages. While the Zippo Manufacturing Company never had an official contract with the military, soldiers and armed forces personnel insisted that base exchange (BX) and post exchange (PX) stores carry this sought-after lighter. [13] [14] While it had previously been common to have Zippos with authorized badges, unit crests, and division insignias, it became popular among the American soldiers of the Vietnam War to get their Zippos engraved with personal mottos. These lighters are now sought after collector's items and popular souvenirs for visitors to Vietnam. [15] After World War II, the Zippo lighter became increasingly used in advertising by companies large and small through the 1960s. [16] Much of the early Zippo lighter advertising are works of art painted by hand, and as technology has evolved, so has the design and finish of the Zippo lighter. The basic mechanism of the Zippo lighter has remained unchanged. In 2002, Zippo expanded its product line to include a variety of utility-style multi-purpose lighters, known as Zippo MPLs. This was followed in 2005 with the Outdoor Utility Lighter, known as the OUL. These lighters are fueled with butane . In August 2007, Zippo released a new butane lighter called the Zippo BLU. [17] A museum called \"Zippo/Case visitors center\" is located in Bradford, Pennsylvania, at 1932 Zippo Drive. This 15,000-square-foot (1,400\u00a0m 2 ) building contains rare and custom made Zippo lighters, and also sells the entire Zippo line. The museum was featured on the NPR program Weekend Edition on Sunday, January 25, 2009. The museum also contains an enormous collection of Case knives. Since the Zippo company's 60th anniversary in 1992, annual editions have been produced for Zippo collectors. From 1949 to 2002, Zippos were also produced in Niagara Falls, Ontario , Canada. [18] Since 1933, over 500,000,000 Zippo lighters have been produced. In 2009, Zippo announced plans to purchase Ronson Consumer Products Corporation , a long-time competitor in the lighter market. [19] On February 3, 2010, the deal was finalized. [20] In March 2011, due to significant decrease of sales from 18 million lighters a year in the mid-1990s to about 12 million lighters a year recently, combined with increasing pressure on people not to smoke, Zippo Manufacturing Co. tried offering a wider variety of products using the Zippo name, such as watches, leisure clothing and eau de cologne. This strategy is similar to the success Victorinox Swiss Army Brands Inc. has had selling watches, luggage, clothing, and fragrance. [21] On June 5, 2012, the company manufactured its 500,000,000th lighter and celebrated its 80th anniversary. Zippo's flint-wheel Ignition A lit 1968 slim model Zippo An open full-size Navy Zippo Brass-based case design with matched insert coloring Zippo point of sale display Usage [ edit ] Zippo lighters, which have gained popularity as \u201cwindproof\u201d lighters, are able to stay lit in harsh weather, due to the design of the windscreen and adequate rate of fuel delivery. A consequence of the windproofing is that it is hard to extinguish a Zippo by blowing out the flame. However, if the flame is blown from the top down, it will be easily extinguished. The proper way to extinguish the lighter is to close the top half, which starves the flame of oxygen, but unlike other lighters, this does not cut the fuel. One of the recognizable features of Zippo is the fact that it burns with a wick. Opening the top lid produces an easily recognizable \"clink\" sound for which Zippo lighters are known, and a different but similarly recognizable \"clunk\" when the lighter is closed. This noise is produced by the spring-loaded toggling cam, a little lever that keeps the lid closed or opened securely. Modern black matte finish Zippo lighter Unlike disposable lighters, Zippo lighters purchased new do not contain fuel. Instructions for safely fueling the Zippo are included in its packaging. Zippo also offers for sale a name brand lighter fluid . Vietnam War [ edit ] Morley Safer , in his August 5, 1965 CBS News report of the Cam Ne affair [22] and Private First Class Reginald \"Malik\" Edwards, the rifleman 9th Regiment, US Marine Corps Danang (June 1965 \u2013 March 1966) whose profile comprises chapter one of Wallace Terry 's book, Bloods: An Oral History of the Vietnam War by Black Veterans (1984), describe the use of Zippo lighters in search and destroy missions during the Vietnam War. Edwards stated: \"when you say level a village, you don't use torches. It's not like in the 1800s. You used a Zippo. Now you would use a Bic. That's just the way we did it. You went in there with your Zippos. Everybody. That's why people bought Zippos. Everybody had a Zippo. It was for burnin' shit down.\" [23] [24] \"Zippo squad\" became a phrase of American military jargon for being assigned to burn a village. [25] The M132 Armored Flamethrower was referred to as a \"Zippo\". [26] Price [ edit ] Current Zippos carry a suggested retail price between US$14.95 and US$11,893.95 (for the 18k solid gold model). [27] In 2001, according to the fall 2003 issue of IUP Magazine, a 1933 model was purchased for $18,000 at a swap meet in Tokyo , and in 2002 the company bought one valued at $12,000 for its own collection. [28] During the 2007 75th anniversary celebrations, Zippo sold a near mint 1933 model for $37,000. [29] All Zippo windproof lighters carry an unlimited lifetime guarantee, promoted using the trademarked phrase \"It works or we fix it for free.\" The corporate web site boasts: \"in almost 75 years, no one has ever spent a cent on the mechanical repair of a Zippo lighter regardless of the lighter\u2019s age or condition.\" [30] Date codes [ edit ] Zippo lighter produced in September 1994 In mid-1955, Zippo started year coding their lighters by the use of dots. From 1966 until 1973 the year code was denoted by combinations of vertical lines . From 1974 until 1981 the coding comprised combinations of forward slashes . In 1979 an error was inadvertently introduced into fabrication, with some lighters reading / on the left and // on the right instead of // on the left and / on the right, but was fixed within the year. From 1982 until June 1986 the coding was by backslash . After July 1986, Zippo began including a date code on all lighters showing the month and year of production. On the left of the underside was stamped a letter A\u2013L, denoting the month (A = January, B = February, C = March, etc.). On the right was a Roman numeral which denoted the year, beginning with II in 1986. [31] However, in 2001, Zippo altered this system, changing the Roman numerals to more conventional Arabic numerals . Thus a Zippo made in August 2004 was stamped H 04. Construction [ edit ] Zippo lighter fluid can The cases of Zippo lighters are typically made of brass and are rectangular with a hinged top. On most models, the top of the case is slightly curved. Inside the case are the works of the lighter. The insert contains the spring-toggle lever that keeps the top closed, the wick, windscreen chimney , flintwheel, and flint , all of which are mounted on an open-bottom metal box that is slightly smaller than the bottom of the outer case, and into which it slips snugly. The hollow part of the interior box encloses five rayon balls (similar to cotton balls) which are in contact with the wick. The bottom of this is covered by a piece of felt approximately 1/4 of an inch thick. Printed on the bottom of the felt (in modern Zippos, not on older models [ year\u00a0needed ] ) are the words, \"LIFT TO FILL,\" to indicate one must lift the felt away from the \"cotton\" in order to refuel it. The fuel, light petroleum distillate or synthetic isoparaffinic hydrocarbon (commonly referred to as lighter fluid or naphtha ), is poured into the rayon balls (sometimes called the \"cotton,\" or the \"batting\"), which absorbs it. It also contains a tube that holds a short, cylindrical flint. The tube has an interior spring and exterior cap-screw that keeps the flint in constant contact with the exterior flint-wheel. Spinning this rough-surfaced wheel against flint results in a spark that ignites the fluid in the wick. All parts of the lighter are replaceable. The Zippo lighter requires 108 manufacturing operations. Zippo BLU & Zippo BLU 2 [ edit ] Zippo released the Zippo BLU in 2007 (although there are many 2005 pre-release models). These are butane torch lighters , which Zippo has gone to great lengths to make sure are still \"identifiable as a Zippo\". Specifically, the lid and cam were \"tuned\" so that the lighter still makes the distinctive \"Zippo click\", and also it is one of the only butane torch lighters that uses a flint and striker wheel. [ citation needed ] There is also the BLU2, which features a more square frame and eliminates the fuel gauge on the side of the original Zippo BLU. [ citation needed ] As of January 1, 2016, the BLU line of lighters are discontinued. Zippo has stated that they will continue to service all previously sold BLU lighters. [32] [33] Zippo subsidiaries [ edit ] In addition to its 2010 purchase of the Ronson brand in the US and Canada, Zippo also owns W. R. Case & Sons Cutlery Co. of Bradford, Pennsylvania, Zippo UK, Ltd. of London, England, and Zippo Fashion Italia of Vicenza, Italy . See also [ edit ] Zippo Manufacturing Co. v. Zippo Dot Com, Inc.

[1] [2] He won the prize in 1965 for his collection of poems in Malayalam Odakkuzhal (The Bamboo Flute, 1950). With part of the prize money he established the literary award Odakkuzhal in 1968. He was also the recipient of the Soviet Land Nehru Award, in 1967, and the Padma Bhushan in 1968. [3] His poetry collection Viswadarshanam won the Kerala Sahitya Akademi Award in 1961 and Kendra Sahitya Akademi Award in 1963. After completing his education, Kurup worked as the Malayalam teacher in a secondary school in Thiruvillwamala in 1921. Later he became a teacher in the Government Secondary Teacher Training Institute near Trichur . He worked as the Malayalam Pandit in Maharaja's College, Ernakulam , and retired as Professor of Malayalam from the College in 1956. Kurup published his first poem, called Salutation to Nature in 1918, while still a student. Apart from 25 collections of poetry, Kurup also wrote verse dramas and collections of literary essays\u2014in all about 40 works in Malayalam.

Indeed, one often speaks of the influence of Tagore and Gandhi on the humanism and nationalism of Kurup. He has also been described as a \"bard of science\" who explored the role of science in achieving the human potential. He also penned the lyrics for P.J.Cherian\u2019s Nirmala , (1948), the first Malayalam film to incorporate music and songs. Kurup also led an active public life as a member (1968\u201372) of Rajya Sabha , the upper house of the Indian parliament .

Ray Ferrier is a divorced crane operator longshoreman who works at a dock in Brooklyn, New York and lives in Bayonne, New Jersey . Ray is estranged from his children. His former wife, Mary Ann, later drops off the children, 10-year-old daughter Rachel and teenage son Robbie, at Ray's house on her way to visit her parents in Boston . Unexplained changes in the weather occur, including lightning that strikes multiple times in the middle of an intersection and disrupts all electricity. Ray joins the crowd at the scene of the lightning strikes, and witnesses a massive \" Tripod \" war machine emerge from the ground and use alien weaponry to disintegrate most of the witnesses, turning them to a grey dust and leaving only their empty clothes behind. Ray collects his children, steals a car and drives to Mary Ann's home in suburban New Jersey to take refuge. The next morning, he discovers that a Boeing 747 has crashed in the street. A news team scavenging for food while surveying the wreckage explain that there are multiple Tripods that have attacked major cities including New York City , Paris , Washington, D.C. , and London , and have force shields to protect them from human weapons. They also explain that the Martians travelled to Earth within the lightning, as a guise to enter the Tripods. Ray decides to take the kids to Boston to be with their mother. The three are forced to abandon the stolen car after a mob takes it by force. They later survive a Tripod attack which causes a Hudson River ferry to sink. During a desperate battle between U.S. Marines and the aliens, Ray is forced to choose between being separated from Rachel and preventing Robbie from joining the fight; he lets Robbie go with the Marines, who are overwhelmed, thus making Ray presume Robbie died during the attack. While escaping, Ray and Rachel are offered shelter by a paramedic, Harlan Ogilvy, who presumes that the aliens had buried their technology on Earth millions of years ago and has delusions that they can fight against the aliens themselves by observing their operations, as they are right next to their camp. The three remain undetected for two days, even as a probe and a group of the Martians themselves explore the basement. They also soon discover that the Martians are growing strange red-colored alien vegetation across the landscape and is quickly growing, covering trees and spreading into the basement, thus explaining the Martians' motives: to colonise Earth for their species, therefore making Earth a Mars-like planet. The next morning, Ogilvy suffers a mental breakdown after witnessing a Tripod harvesting human blood and tissue to fertilize the alien vegetation . Convinced that Ogilvy's mad shouting will alert the Martians to their location, Ray reluctantly kills him. The basement hideout is eventually exposed when a second probe catches them sleeping. Rachel is soon abducted by a nearby Tripod; Ray allows himself to be abducted, and is placed in the same cage with Rachel and a number of other prisoners. As the Tripod selects him for harvesting, Ray takes a belt of grenades into the machine in his place, having pulled out the pins. The Tripod is destroyed and releases the cage, with Ray and Rachel, and the other prisoners, making it out alive. Ray and Rachel arrive in a devastated Boston, where they discover that the Martian vegetation is dying and most of the Tripods have collapsed. When an active Tripod appears, Ray notices birds landing on it, indicating that its shields have been deactivated. Ray alerts the soldiers escorting the fleeing crowd and they shoot it down with Javelin launchers. As the soldiers advance on the downed Tripod, a hatch opens releasing a liquid; a dying Martian struggles halfway out, and then dies immediately. Ray and Rachel reach Mary Ann's parents' house, where they are reunited with Mary Ann and Robbie, who is revealed to be alive. The closing narration reveals that although the Martians were immune to the humans' weapons, their vegetation was not immune to the microbes present on Earth and that \"From the moment the invaders arrived, breathed our air, ate and drank, they were doomed. They were undone, destroyed, after all of man's weapons and devices had failed, by the tiniest creatures that God in his wisdom put upon this earth. By the toll of a billion deaths, man had earned his immunity, his right to survive among this planet's infinite organisms. And that right is ours against all challenges. For neither do men live nor die in vain.\". Cast [ edit ] Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning portray the two main characters of the film. Tom Cruise as Ray Ferrier Dakota Fanning as Rachel Ferrier Justin Chatwin as Robbie Ferrier Miranda Otto as Mary Ann Ferrier Tim Robbins as Harlan Ogilvy Rick Gonzalez as Vincent Yul V\u00e1zquez as Julio Lenny Venito as Manny the Mechanic Lisa Ann Walter as Cheryl Ann Robinson as Grandmother (she played the lead role of Sylvia van Buren in the 1953 film) Gene Barry as Grandfather (he played lead role of Dr. Clayton Forrester in the 1953 film) David Alan Basche as Tim Roz Abrams as Herself Camillia Sanes as News Producer Amy Ryan as Neighbor with Toddler Danny Hoch as Policeman Morgan Freeman as the Narrator (voice) Channing Tatum as Boy in Church Scene (uncredited) Dee Bradley Baker as Alien Vocals (uncredited) Columbus Short as Soldier (uncredited) Production [ edit ] Development [ edit ] After collaborating in 2002's Minority Report , Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise were interested in working together again. Spielberg stated about Cruise, \"He's such an intelligent, creative partner, and brings such great ideas to the set that we just spark each other. I love working with Tom Cruise.\" [2] Cruise met with Spielberg during the filming of Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can (2002) and gave three options of films to create together, one of them being an adaptation of The War of the Worlds . [2] Spielberg chose The War of the Worlds and stated, \"We looked at each other and the lights went on. As soon as I heard it, I said 'Oh my God! War of the Worlds \u2013 absolutely.' That was it.\" [2] The film is Spielberg's third on the subject of alien visitation, along with Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial . Producer and longtime collaborator Kathleen Kennedy notes that with War of the Worlds , Spielberg had the opportunity to explore the antithesis of the characters brought to life in E.T. and Close Encounters of the Third Kind . \"When we first started developing E.T. , it was a much edgier, darker story and it actually evolved into something that was more benign. I think that the edgier, darker story has always been somewhere inside him. Now, he's telling that story.\" [2] Spielberg stated that he just thought it would be fun to make a \"really scary film with really scary aliens\", something which he had never done before. [2] [3] Spielberg was intent on telling a contemporary story, with Kennedy stating the story was created as a fantasy , but depicted in a hyper-realistic way. [2] \"For the first time in my life I'm making an alien picture where there is no love and no attempt at communication.\" \u2013 Steven Spielberg [4] J. J. Abrams was asked by Spielberg and Cruise to write the script but had to turn down the film as he was working on the pilot for his television series Lost . [5] Josh Friedman delivered a screenplay, which was then rewritten by David Koepp . [6] [7] After re-reading the novel, Koepp decided to do the script following a single narrator, \"a very limited point of view, from someone on the very periphery of events rather than someone involved in events\", and created a list of elements he would not use due to being \" clich\u00e9 \", such as the destruction of landmark buildings. Some aspects of the book were heavily adapted and condensed: Tim Robbins' character was an amalgam of two characters in the book, with the name borrowed from a third. While changing the setting from 19th century to present day, Koepp also tried to \"take the modern world back to the 1800s\", with the characters being devoid of electricity and modern techniques of communication. [8] Spielberg accepted the script after finding it had several similarities to his personal life , including the divorce of his parents (Ray and Mary Ann's divorce), and because the plight of the fictional survivors reflects his own uncertainty after the devastation of the September 11 attacks . [3] For Spielberg, the characters' stories of survival needed to be the main focus, as they featured the American mindset of never giving up. [3] Spielberg described War of the Worlds as \"a polar opposite\" to Close Encounters , with that movie featuring a man leaving family to travel with aliens, while War of the Worlds focused on keeping the family together. [3] At the same time, the aliens and their motivations would not be much explored, as \"we just experience the results of these nefarious plans to replace us with themselves\". [9] Although accepting the script, Spielberg asked for several changes. Spielberg had been against the idea of the aliens arriving in spaceships , since every alien invasion movie used such a vehicle. [7] The original Martian cylinders were discarded, where Spielberg replaced the origins of the Tripods with stating they were buried underground in the Earth long ago. [4] [7] Spielberg had Miranda Otto in mind for the part of Mary Ann, but at the time he called her she was pregnant and thought the opportunity would be missed. Spielberg then decided to incorporate Otto's pregnancy into the film, changing the part for her. Lawrence Brown wrote: \"Spielberg's decision to present the invaders' fighting machines as having been there all along, buried deep under the Earth, raises questions which did not exist in the original Wells book. In Spielberg's version, these invaders had been here before, long ago, in prehistoric times. They had set up their machines deep underground, and departed. Why? Why not take over the Earth right there and then? Spielberg does not provide an answer, and the characters are too busy surviving to wonder about this. An answer suggests itself - a very chilling answer. The invaders were interested in humans as food animals. When they came here before, humans were very scarce. The aliens left their hidden machines and departed, patiently observing the Earth until humans would multiply to the requisite numbers - and then they came back, to take over. Under this interpretation, all of us - all humans over the whole of history - have been livestock living in an alien food farm, destined to be 'harvested'\". [10] Filming [ edit ] Destroyed Boeing 747 used on the War of the Worlds set. Currently, visitors can view the destroyed airliner set during the Universal Studios Hollywood 's Studio Tour . Filming took place in Virginia , Connecticut , New Jersey , California , and New York . The film shooting lasted an estimated 72 days. [11] Spielberg originally intended to shoot War of the Worlds after Munich , but Tom Cruise liked David Koepp's script so much that he suggested Spielberg postpone the former while he would do the same with Mission: Impossible III . Most of Munich' s crew was brought in to work on War of the Worlds as well. [4] In 2004, the production crews quickly were set up on both coasts to prepare for the start date, scouting locations up and down the Eastern Seaboard and preparing stages and sets which would be used when the company returned to Los Angeles after the winter holiday. Pre-production took place in only three months, essentially half the amount of time normally allotted for a film of similar size and scope. Spielberg notes, however, \"This wasn't a cram course for War of the Worlds . This was my longest schedule in about 12 years. We took our time.\" [2] Spielberg collaborated with crews at the beginning of pre-production with the use of previsualization , considering the tight schedule. [11] The scene depicting the first appearance of the Tripods was filmed at the intersection of Ferry Street, Merchart Street, and Wilson Avenue, in Newark, New Jersey . [12] Later, Spielberg filmed several scenes in Virginia . [13] The continuous scene was filmed in California. [14] The ferry scene was filmed in the New York town of Athens , and Mary Ann's parents' house was located in Brooklyn (but was featured in the film in Boston). [2] For the neighborhood plane crash scene, the production crew bought a retired Boeing 747 , with transportation costs of $2 million, [15] destroyed it into pieces, and built houses around them. [2] The destroyed plane was kept for the Universal Studios back-lot tour. [15] Ray's house was filmed in Bayonne, New Jersey (with a soundstage doubling the interior); meanwhile, the valley war sequence was filmed in Lexington , Virginia and Mystery Mesa in California. The scene where the tripod is shot down and crashes through a factory was filmed in Naugatuck, Connecticut at the since dismantled Naugatuck Chemical. The scene of the bodies floating down the river was filmed on the Farmington River in Windsor, Connecticut by a second unit using a stand in for Dakota Fanning (the back of her character) with the portion showing the faces of the credited actors cut in later. Some filming was shot on the Korean War Veterans Parkway in Staten Island , NY. [2] [16] The film used six sound stages, spread over three studio lots. [2] Design and visual effects [ edit ] Industrial Light & Magic was the main special effects company for the movie. [17] While Spielberg had used computers to help visualize sequences in pre-production before, Spielberg said, \"This is the first film I really tackled using the computer to animate all the storyboards.\" [2] He decided to employ the technique extensively after a visit to his friend George Lucas . [2] [17] In order to keep the realism, the usage of computer-generated imagery shots and bluescreen was limited, with most of the digital effects being blended with miniature and live-action footage. [18] The design of the Tripods was described by Spielberg as \"graceful,\" with artist Doug Chiang replicating aquatic life forms. [18] At the same time, the director wanted a design that would be iconic while still providing a tribute to the original Tripods, as well as intimidating so the audience would not be more interested about the aliens inside than on the vehicle itself. [9] The visual effects crew tried to blend organic and mechanical elements in the Tripods depiction, and made extensive studies for the movements of the vehicle to be believable, considering the \"contradiction\" of having a large tank-like head being carried by thin and flexible legs. [19] Animator Randal M. Dutra considered the movements themselves to have a \"terrestrial buoyance\", in that they were walking on land but had an aquatic flow, and Spielberg described the Tripods as moving like \"scary ballet dancers\". Most of the alien elements revolved around the number three \u2013 the Tripod had three eyes, and both the vehicle and the aliens had three main limbs with three fingers each. [9] Visual effects supervisor Pablo Helman considered depicting the scale of the Tripod as challenging, considering \"Steven wanted to make sure that these creatures were 150 feet tall\", [18] as it was the height described by Wells in the novel. [9] The aliens themselves had designs based on jellyfish, with movements inspired by red-eyed tree frogs , [19] and an amphibian quality particularly on the wet skin. A styrofoam alien was used as a stand-in to guide the actors in the basement scene. [9] Spielberg did not want any blood or gore during the Heat-Ray deaths; in the words of Helman, \"this was going to be a horror movie for kids\". So the effects crew came up with the vaporization of the bodies, and considering it could not be fully digital due to both the complexity of the effect and the schedule, live-action dust was used alongside the CGI ray assimilation and particles. [18] Digital birds followed the Tripods in most scenes to symbolize the presence of death, which Chiang compared to vultures and added that \"you don't know if these birds are going to the danger or away from it, if you should follow them or run away.\" [9] During the scene where Ray's stolen minivan is attacked by a mob, Janusz Kaminski and Spielberg wanted a lot of interactive lights, so they added different kinds of lights, including Coleman lamps , oil lanterns , flashlights and Maglights . [2] The IL&M crew admitted that the destruction of the Bayonne Bridge was the toughest scene to be made with heavy usage mix of CGI effects and live action elements, [20] and a four-week deadline so the shot could be used in a Super Bowl trailer. [18] The scene originally had only a gas station exploding, but then Spielberg suggested blowing up the bridge as well. [18] The scene involved Tripods shooting a Heat-Ray towards the minivan and minivan escapes from it involved a lot of CGI layers to work out. Over 500 CGI effects were used in the film. [21] Costume designer Joanna Johnston created 60 different versions of Ray's leather jacket, to illustrate the degrees to which he is weathered from the beginning of the journey to the end. \"He begins with the jacket, a hoodie , and two t-shirts,\" explains Johnston. One piece of Dakota Fanning 's costume that takes on a special importance is her lavender horse purse: \"I wanted her to have something that made her feel safe, some little thing that she could sleep with and put over her face,\" Johnston notes. \"That was the lavender horse purse. We tied it up on a ribbon and Dakota hung it on her body, so it was with her at all times.\" Johnston dressed Robbie for an unconscious emulation of his father, \"They're more alike than they realize, with great tension on the surface,\" Johnston says. [2] Music [ edit ] War of the Worlds: Music from the Motion Picture Film score by John Williams Released June 13, 2005 Studio Sony Pictures Studios Genre Soundtrack Length 61 : 01 Label Decca Records Producer John Williams John Williams chronology Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (2005) Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith 2005 War of the Worlds (2005) Memoirs of a Geisha (2005) Memoirs of a Geisha 2005 Professional ratings Review scores Source Rating AllMusic [22] Filmtracks ScoreNotes C+ SoundtrackNet Longtime Spielberg collaborator John Williams composed the music score of War of the Worlds . It was the first time Williams had to compose with an incomplete Spielberg film, as only the first six reels, totalling sixty minutes, were ready for him to use as reference. [23] He considered the score \"a very serious piece,\" which had to combine \"necessary frightening atmosphere\" with \"propulsively rhythmic drive for the action scenes\" \u2013 [24] the music would be symbolically \"pulling forward\" vehicles in chase scenes such as Ray driving out of Bayonne or the Tripod attacking the Hudson ferry. Williams added small nods to classic monster movie scores by having orchestras doing a \"grand gesture\" in scenes overlooking Tripods. To increase the scariness, Williams added a female chorus with a crescendo resembling a shriek \u2013 which would \"humanize\" the track representing \"victims that go out without saying an 'ouch' \u2013 they're gone before they can say that\" \u2013 for the Tripod attacks, and a nearly inaudible male choir \u2013 which Williams compared to \" Tibetan monks , the lowest known pitch our bodies can make\" \u2013 for the aliens exploring the basement. The only deviation from orchestras were electronic sounds for the opening and closing narrations. [23] A soundtrack album was released by Decca Records , that featured the film's music and Morgan Freeman's opening and closing narration. [25] [26] The songs \" Little Deuce Coupe \" and \" Hushabye Mountain \" are also featured in the movie, the former sung by Tom Cruise, and the latter by Dakota Fanning.

[29] Debra J. Saunders of San Francisco Chronicle described the film as \"If aliens invade, don't fight back. Run.\" Saunders compared the film to Independence Day , where the civilians do run, but they support the military efforts. [29] Many reviewers considered the film tried to recreate the atmosphere of the September 11 attacks , with bystanders struggling to survive and the usage of missing-persons displays. [30] Spielberg declared to Reader's Digest that beside the work being a fantasy, the threat represented was real: \"They are a wake-up call to face our fears as we confront a force intent on destroying our way of life.\" [31] Screenwriter David Koepp stated that he tried not to put explicit references to September 11 or the Iraq War , but said that the inspiration for the scene where Robbie joins the Marines was teenagers fighting in the Gaza Strip \u2013 \"I was thinking of teenagers in Gaza throwing bottles and rocks at tanks, and I think that when you're that age you don't fully consider the ramifications of what you're doing and you're very much caught up in the moment and passion, whether that's a good idea or not.\" [8] Retained from the novel is the aliens being defeated, not by men's weapons, but the planet's smallest creatures, bacteria , which Koepp described as \"nature, in a way, knowing a whole lot more than we do\". [9] Release [ edit ] War of the Worlds premiered at the Ziegfeld Theatre on June 23, 2005. There, Tom Cruise revealed his relationship with Katie Holmes . [32] Six days later, on June 29, the film was released in approximately 3,908 theaters across America. [1] The home video was subsequently released on November 22, 2005. Secrecy [ edit ] Spielberg kept most of the parts secret in the filmmaking, as the cast and crew were left confused about how the aliens looked. [33] When asked about the secrecy of the screenplay, David Koepp answered, \"[Spielberg] wouldn't give [the screenplay] to anybody \". Koepp explained he would e-mail it to him, and he would give a section of the script that was relating to whatever somebody was doing. [33] Miranda Otto thought of not even discussing the story with her family and friends. Otto said, \"I know some people who always say, 'Oh, everything's so secret.' I think it's good. In the old days people didn't get to know much about movies before they came out and nowadays there's just so much information. I think a bit of mystery is always really good. You don't want to blow all of your cards beforehand.\" [34] Spielberg admitted after keeping things secret for so long, there is in the end the temptation to reveal too much to the detriment of the story at the press conference of War of the Worlds . So, Spielberg only revealed the hill scene, where Ray tries to stop his son from leaving, stating \"to say more would reveal too much.\" [35] The secrecy caused The Sun to claim the film would surpass Titanic ' s US $200 million budget, which at the time held the record for the most expensive film ever made. [36] The actual budget of the film was $132 million. [1] [37] According to Vanity Fair , Spielberg's relations with Cruise were \"poor\" during the film's release because Spielberg believed Cruise's \"antics\" at the time (such as an erratic appearance on the Oprah Winfrey show) had \"hurt\" the film. [38] Marketing and home media releases [ edit ] Paramount Pictures Interactive Marketing debuted a human survival online game on its official website , waroftheworlds.com , on April 14 to promote the film. [39] Hitachi collaborated with Paramount Pictures for a worldwide promotional campaign , under the title of \u201cThe Ultimate Visual Experience\u201d . The agreement was announced by Kazuhiro Tachibana, general manager of Hitachi\u2019s Consumer Business Group. [40] Kazuhiro stated, \"Our \u2018The Ultimate Visual Experience\u2019 campaign is a perfect match between Spielberg and Cruise\u2019s pursuit of the world\u2019s best in film entertainment and Hitachi\u2019s commitment to the highest picture quality through its digital consumer electronic products .\" [40] The film was released on VHS and DVD on November 22, 2005, with both a single-disc edition and a two-disc special edition which included production featurettes, documentaries and various trailers. [41] The film grossed $113,000,000 in DVD sales, bringing its total film gross to $704,745,540, ranking tenth place in the 2005 DVD sales chart. [42] Paramount released the film on Blu-ray Disc on June 1, 2010. Reception [ edit ] Box office [ edit ] On June\u00a029,\u00a02005 ( 2005-06-29 ) , the film grossed approximately US$81 million worldwide, [43] and earned the thirty-eighth biggest opening week by grossing $98,826,764 in 3,908 theatres, averaging out to $25,288 in each theater. [44] Meanwhile, on Independence Day weekend, War of the Worlds grossed $64,878,725 in 3908 theatres also, giving an average of $16,601. [45] This is the third-biggest film opening on Independence Day weekend. [46] The film earned $200 million in 24 days, ranking thirty-seventh place in the list of fastest films to gross $200 million. [47] The film has grossed $704,745,540 including DVD sales, [1] making it the fourth highest grossing film of 2005 , and the 66th highest grossing film worldwide. [48] [49] Critical reaction [ edit ] The film received generally positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator website Metacritic gave the film an average score of 73 based on 40 reviews. [50] Rotten Tomatoes gives War of the Worlds a 74% \"fresh\" rating based on 251 reviews and the critical consensus: \"Steven Spielberg's adaptation of War of the Worlds delivers on the thrill and paranoia of H.G. Wells' classic novel while impressively updating the action and effects for modern audiences.\" [51] Many people praised the film's beginning while criticizing the ending. James Berardinelli praised the acting and considered that focusing the narrative on the struggle of one character made the film more effective, but described the ending as weak, even though Spielberg \"does the best he can to make it cinematically dramatic\". [52] Total Film ' s review gave War of the Worlds 4 out of 5 stars, considering that \"Spielberg finds fresh juice in a tale already adapted for film, TV, stage, radio and record\", and describing the film as having many \"startling images\", comparing the first Tripod attack to the Omaha Beach landing from Saving Private Ryan . [53] Los Angeles Times ' Kenneth Turan , who felt the special effects were unusual, stated that Spielberg may actually have done his job in War of the Worlds \"better than he realizes\", showing how fragile the world is. Turan claimed Spielberg raised a most provocative question: \"Is the ultimate fantasy an invasion from outer space, or is it the survival of the human race?\" [54] However, Broomfield Enterprise ' s Dan Marcucci and Nancy Serougi did not share Berardinelli and Turan's opinion. They felt that Morgan Freeman's narration was unnecessary, and that the first half was \"great\" but the second half \"became filled with clich\u00e9s, riddled with holes, and tainted by Tim Robbins\". [55] Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three and a half stars (out of four), saying \" War of the Worlds definitely wins its battle, but not the war.\" Wilmington stated the film brought the viewers on a wild journey through two sides of Spielberg: the dark and the light. He also said the film contained a core sentiment similar to that of Spielberg's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial . [56] About.com 's Rebecca Murray gave a positive review, stating, \"Spielberg almost succeeds in creating the perfect alien movie\", with criticism only for the ending. [57] Jonathan Rosenbaum of Chicago Reader praised the special effects and Cruise's performance. [58] Roger Ebert criticized the \"retro design\" and considered that despite the big budget, the alien invasion was \"rudimentary\" and \"not very interesting\", regarding the best scenes as Ray walking among the airliner wreckage and a train running in flames, declaring that \"such scenes seem to come from a kind of reality different from that of the tripods.\" [59] The French film magazine Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma ranked the film as 8th place in its list of best films of the 2000s. [60] Japanese film director Kiyoshi Kurosawa listed the film as the best film of 2000-2009. [61] Accolades [ edit ] War of the Worlds was nominated for three Academy Awards , including Visual Effects ( Pablo Helman ), Sound Mixing ( Andy Nelson , Anna Behlmer and Ron Judkins ), and Sound Editing , losing all to King Kong . [62] The film was nominated for six Saturn Awards , [63] and won Best Performance by a Younger Actor (Dakota Fanning). [64] The film won a Golden Reel Award for Sound Effects & Foley, [65] a World Soundtrack Award for Best Original Soundtrack, [66] and three VES Awards for its special effects, [67] and was nominated for three Empire Awards , three Satellite Awards , and an MTV Movie Award .

His father, a German immigrant, owned a leather goods store, and his mother once worked for Film Facilities in Wellington. Through his mother, the young Urban was exposed to classic New Zealand cinema , and developed an interest in the film industry. [2] Urban attended St Mark's Church School , where he showed an early love for public performance. His first acting role came at age eight, when he had a single line in one episode of the New Zealand television series Pioneer Woman . Though continuing to take part in school stage productions, he did not act professionally again until after high school. He attended Wellington College in 1986\u20131990. He then enrolled at Victoria University of Wellington in the Bachelor of Arts program but left after one year to pursue a career in acting. Over the next few years, he appeared in several local TV commercials in addition to theater roles in the Wellington area. Eventually he moved to Auckland , where he was offered many guest roles in TV shows (one of which was playing a heroin addict in the police drama Shark in the Park ). Urban then moved briefly to Bondi Beach , Sydney, Australia in 1995, before returning to New Zealand the following year.

[10] His performance was widely embraced by the Star Trek fan community for its faithfulness to the spirit of Kelley's McCoy. [11] In 2009, he also appeared as himself in the documentary film Reclaiming the Blade , discussing his sword-wielding experience in films such as The Lord of the Rings .

[13] In 2012, Urban starred as law-enforcing comic book hero Judge Dredd in the film Dredd . In an interview with Shave magazine, Urban described it as a \"high-octane, action-fueled film... about the day in the life of Dredd.\" The film was directed by Pete Travis, with a script by Alex Garland. [14] Though it underperformed at the box office, Dredd was well received by critics. [15] He then reprised his role of \"Bones\" McCoy in the sequel to Star Trek , Star Trek Into Darkness , which was released on 15 May 2013. In 2013, Urban starred as Detective John Kennex in Almost Human , a TV series created by J. H. Wyman .

[3] [4] He is the younger brother of actor Randy Quaid . Career [ edit ] Quaid dropped out of the University of Houston before graduating and moved to Hollywood to pursue an acting career. [2] He initially had trouble finding work but began to gain notice when he appeared in Breaking Away (1979) and earned good reviews for his role as astronaut Gordon Cooper in The Right Stuff (1983). [2] Known for his grin, [5] Quaid has appeared in both comedic and dramatic roles.

He also achieved acclaim for his portrayal of Jerry Lee Lewis in Great Balls of Fire! (1989). [2] In 1989, he also appeared throughout the Bonnie Raitt music video for the song \"Thing Called Love.\" [6] Quaid's career lost steam in the early 1990s, after he fought anorexia nervosa brought on when he lost 40 pounds to play the tuberculosis-afflicted Doc Holliday in Wyatt Earp [7] and kicked a cocaine addiction as well. [2] He continued to garner positive reviews in a variety of films, however. [2] Quaid was also the guest star of a season 2 episode of Muppets Tonight (1997). He starred in the lead role in the 1996 adventure film Dragonheart , the remake of The Parent Trap (1998), playing the part of the twins' father, and as an aging pro football quarterback in Oliver Stone 's Any Given Sunday (1999). Some of Quaid's more recent film credits include Frequency (2000), The Rookie (2002), Far from Heaven (2002), Cold Creek Manor (2003), The Flight of the Phoenix (2004), The Alamo (2004), In Good Company (2004), The Day After Tomorrow (2004), Yours, Mine and Ours (2005), Vantage Point (2008), G.I.

[8] In 2018, Quaid starred in I Can Only Imagine , where he played Arthur Millard, the father of singer and songwriter Bart Millard . Personal life [ edit ] Relationships and children [ edit ] Quaid has been married three times and has three children. Quaid and his first wife, actress P. J. Soles , were married on November 25, 1978. The couple divorced in 1983. [1] Quaid playing golf in 2006 On February 14, 1991, Quaid married actress Meg Ryan . Quaid and Ryan fell in love during the shooting of their second film together, D.O.A. [9] Quaid and Ryan have a son, Jack Henry (born April 24, 1992). [10] They announced their separation on June 28, 2000, saying they had been separated six weeks by then. [9] Their divorce was finalized July 16, 2001. [1] Ryan later revealed to InStyle Quaid had been unfaithful to her for a long time while they were married. [11] Quaid dated model Shanna Moakler in 2001. They were together when she was approached by Playboy , and they discussed it before she posed nude in the magazine. [12] The relationship lasted for eight months. [13] Quaid married Texas real-estate agent Kimberly Buffington, on July 4, 2004, at his ranch in Paradise Valley, Montana . [14] They have fraternal twins, Thomas Boone and Zoe Grace, born via a surrogate on November 8, 2007, in Santa Monica, California . [15] [16] On November 18, 2007, hospital staff mistakenly gave Quaid's ten-day-old twins a dosage of heparin 1,000 times the common dosage for infants. [17] [18] Their attorney said the newborns will \"be fine now,\" but Quaid filed a lawsuit against the drug manufacturer, Baxter Healthcare , claiming that packaging for the two doses of heparin are not different enough. [19] In May 2008, the Quaids testified before the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , asking U.S. Congress not to preempt the right to sue drug manufacturers for negligence under state law. [20] This incident led Quaid to become a patient-safety advocate, producing a series of documentaries on preventable medical errors that aired on the Discovery Channel [21] [22] as well as co-authoring a medical journal article addressing the positive influence of patient stories in motivating change in healthcare. [23] The first documentary, Chasing Zero: Winning the War on Healthcare Harm , aired on the Discovery Channel in 2010, [21] [22] and the second documentary, Surfing the Healthcare Tsunami: Bring Your Best Board , aired on the Discovery Channel in 2012. [24] [25] [26] [27] Buffington filed for divorce from Quaid in March 2012. According to the divorce petition, the marriage had become \"insupportable because of discord or conflict of personalities.\" [28] Buffington's attorney then withdrew the divorce papers on April 26, 2012. [29] In the summer of 2012, Quaid and Buffington moved to California. [30] In October 2012, Quaid and Buffington again decided to separate, and Buffington filed for legal separation, seeking joint legal and sole physical custody of the twins. [31] After waiting to establish the required six months of residency in California, Quaid filed for divorce on November 30, 2012, asking for joint legal and physical custody of the children and offering to pay spousal support to Buffington. [30] They then reconciled and the divorce was dismissed by September 2013. [32] On June 28, 2016, the couple announced in a joint statement that they were divorcing, with Kimberly Quaid asking for full physical custody and joint legal custody. [33] Interests [ edit ] In addition to acting, Quaid is a musician and plays with his band, the Sharks. He wrote and performed the song \"Closer to You\" in the film The Big Easy (1987). Quaid also had a pilot's license and owned a Cessna Citation . [34] He is also a one-handicap golfer, and in 2005, he was named as the top golfer among the \"Hollywood set\" by Golf Digest magazine. Quaid is a fan of the AL 's Houston Astros , and after the team's 2005 National League Championship-winning season, he narrated their commemorative DVD release. After the filming of The Express: The Ernie Davis Story , Quaid went to Cleveland Browns Stadium to dedicate Davis's jersey. Substance use [ edit ] There have been extensive stories about Quaid's past abuse of cocaine . In a candid 2002 interview with Larry King on his talk show, after King asked about his motives for using drugs, Quaid responded, \"Well, you got to put it in context. Back in the late 1960s, early 1970s. That was back during the time where, you know, drugs were going to expand our minds and everybody was experimenting and everything. We were really getting high, we didn't know it. And cocaine at that time was considered harmless. You know. I remember magazine articles in 'People' Magazine of doctors saying, it is not addicting. It is just\u2014alcohol is worse. So I think we all fell into that. But that's not the way it was.\" When asked if he believed he had ever been addicted to the drugs, he responded, \"It was a gradual thing. But it got to the point where I couldn't have any fun unless I had it. Which is a bad place to be.\" Later in the interview he said, \"But I saw myself being dead in about five years if I didn't stop.\" [35] Charities [ edit ] Quaid lent his name to the annual \"Dennis Quaid Charity Weekend\" (formerly the \" Jiffy Lube /Dennis Quaid Charity Classic\"), held in Austin from 2002 till 2007. The golf tournament attracted numerous celebrities with the proceeds split among local children's charities. Quaid at the 2009 Texas Film Hall of Fame Awards Quaid worked with the International Hospital for Children in New Orleans . He made several trips to Central America in the nineties to help build medical clinics and transport sick children back to the U.S. for treatment they cannot get locally.

Some versions feature an instrumental introduction with the refrain used before the first verse begins. The longer version usually omits this due to the slowness of the first verse which is sung. The song is an example of accelerando , in which the tempo of the song gradually increases commensurate with the increasing speed of the drivers. [1] The song is noted for its unusual instrument that makes the beeping sounds. Contents [ hide ] 1 Lyrical Content 2 Charts 3 In popular culture 4 References Lyrical Content [ edit ] The narrator, the driver of a Cadillac , is approached from behind by a Nash Rambler apparently wanting to pass. The narrator, believing that it would be a disgrace for a Rambler \"about 1/3 my size\" to pass a Cadillac, continually increases his speed to \"show him that a Cadillac is not a car to scorn\". However, the Rambler continues to follow closely behind the Cadillac, and ultimately pulls along side him while both cars are going 120 MPH. It turns out the Rambler's driver simply wants to ask the narrator a question: \"HEY, BUDDY, HOW DO YOU GET THIS CAR OUT OF SECOND GEAR?\" Charts [ edit ] The song was on the Billboard Top 40 charts for twelve weeks, and peaked at #4. [2] It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc . [3] The Playmates appeared on the Milton Berle Show televised December 3, 1958, at the height of the song's popularity. [4] [5] Concurrently with this song, American Motors (AMC) was setting production and sales records for the Rambler models. [6] The \"Beep Beep\" song was also popular with the workers building the Rambler cars on AMC's assembly lines in Kenosha, Wisconsin . [7] Because of a directive by the BBC that songs not include brand names in their lyrics , a UK re-recorded version of \"Beep Beep\" was recorded for the European market replacing the Cadillac and Nash Rambler with the generic terms the Limousine and Bubble car . [8] In popular culture [ edit ] Homage is made to the \"Beep Beep\" in the 1959 hit song \" Jo Jo The Dog Faced Boy \" with the line, \"Where in the world was the little Nash Rambler?\". \"Jo Jo The Dog Faced Boy\" was sung by featured Mickey Mouse Club singer, Annette Funicello and written by Bob & Dick Sherman and Bob Roberts . [9] The song is sampled in the Marilyn Manson song \"Misery Machine\", which appears on the 1994 album Portrait of an American Family . [10] [11] In the Full House season 6 episode \"Grand Gift Auto\", Danny plays his guitar while singing the chorus of the song (at a much faster tempo than the original) to D.J., Kimmy, and Steve in order to create a diversion while Joey and Jesse are completing repairs on D.J.'s birthday gift, a 1977 Pontiac Firebird .

The company was founded by Dan Evins in 1969; its first store was in Lebanon, Tennessee , which remains the company headquarters. The chain's stores were at first positioned near Interstate highway exits in the Southeastern and Midwestern United States, but has expanded across the country during the 1990s and 2000s. As of  September\u00a018, 2012 [update] , [4] the chain operates 639 stores in 43 states. Cracker Barrel's menu is based on traditional Southern cuisine , with appearance and decor designed to resemble an old-fashioned general store . Each restaurant features a front porch lined with wooden rocking chairs , a stone fireplace , and decorative artifacts from the local area. Cracker Barrel is known for its partnerships with country music performers. It has received attention for its charitable activities, such as its assistance of victims of Hurricane Katrina and injured war veterans.\nEmployees there wear a choice of either white, yellow, blue or pink shirts. During the 1990s, the company was the subject of controversy for its official stance against gay and lesbian employees and for discriminatory practices against African-American customers and female employees. In 2004, a U.S. Department of Justice (USDOJ) investigation found that Cracker Barrel discriminated against minority customers; patrons complained of racially segregated seating and service quality. In an agreement with the USDOJ, Cracker Barrel implemented non-discrimination policies and pledged to focus on improving minority representation and civic involvement, particularly in the black community. Company shareholders added sexual orientation to the company's non-discrimination policy in 2002.

[5] Designed to resemble the traditional country store that he remembered from his childhood, with a name chosen to give it a Southern country theme, [6] Cracker Barrel was intended to attract the interest of highway travelers. [5] The first restaurant was built close to Interstate 40 , in Lebanon, Tennessee . [7] It opened in September 1969, [8] serving Southern cuisine including biscuits , grits , country ham, and turnip greens . [7] Evins incorporated Cracker Barrel in February 1970, [5] and soon opened more locations. In the early 1970s, the firm leased land on gasoline station sites near interstate highways to build restaurants. [6] These early locations all featured gas pumps on-site; during gasoline shortages in the mid to late 1970s, the firm began to build restaurants without pumps. [5] Into the early 1980s, the company reduced the number of gas stations on-site, eventually phasing them out altogether as the company focused on its restaurant and gift sales revenues. [8] Cracker Barrel became a publicly traded company in 1981 to raise funds for further expansion. [5] [7] It floated more than half a million shares, raising $4.6 million. [6] Following the initial public offering, Cracker Barrel grew at a rate of around 20\u00a0percent per year; [9] by 1987, the company had become a chain of more than 50 units in eight states, with annual net sales of almost $81 million. [5] New markets and refocus [ edit ] A Cracker Barrel in Minnesota The company grew consistently through the 1980s and 1990s, attaining a $1 billion market value by 1992. [7] [10] [11] In 1993, the chain's revenue was nearly twice that of any other family restaurant. [6] In 1994, the chain tested a carry-out-only store, Cracker Barrel Old Country Store Corner Market, in suburban residential neighborhoods. [11] In addition, it expanded into new markets through the establishment of more traditional Cracker Barrel locations, the majority of them outside the South, and tested alterations to its menus to adapt to new regions. [12] The chain added regional dishes to its menus, including eggs and salsa in Texas and Reuben sandwiches in New York, but continued to offer its original menu items in all restaurants. [10] By September 1997, Cracker Barrel had 314 restaurants, and aimed to increase the number of stores by approximately 50 per year over the following five years. [12] The firm closed its Corner Market operations in 1997 and refocused on its restaurant and gift store locations. Its then president, Ron Magruder, stated that the chain was concentrating on strengthening its core theme, offering traditional foods and retail in a country store setting, with good service and country music. [9] The chain opened its first restaurant and gift store not located near a highway in 1998, in Dothan, Alabama . [13] In the 2000s, in the wake of incidents including charges of racial discrimination and controversy over its policy of firing gay employees, the firm launched a series of promotional activities including a nationwide book drive and a sweepstakes with trips to the Country Music Association Awards and rocking chairs among the prizes. [14] Recent operations [ edit ] The number of combined restaurants and stores owned by Cracker Barrel increased between 1997 and 2000, to more than 420 locations. In 2000 and 2001, the company addressed staffing and infrastructure issues related to this rapid growth by implementing a more rigorous recruitment strategy and introducing new technology, including an order-placement system . [15] From the late 1990s to the mid-2000s, the company focused on opening new locations in residential areas to attract local residents and workers as customers. [13] It updated its marketing in 2006 to encourage new customers, changing the design of its highway billboard advertisements to include images of menu items. Previously the signs had featured only the company's logo. [16] By 2011, Cracker Barrel had opened more than 600 restaurants in 42 states. [17] [18] [19] On January 17, 2012, company founder Dan Evins died of bladder cancer . [20] Restaurants [ edit ] A Cracker Barrel gift shop Food and gift shop [ edit ] As a Southern-themed chain, Cracker Barrel serves traditional Southern comfort food often described as \"down-home\" country cooking and sells gift items including simple toys representative of the 1950s and 1960s, toy vehicles, puzzles, and woodcrafts. Also sold are country music CDs, DVDs of early classic television, cookbooks, baking mixes , kitchen novelty decor, and early classic brands of candy and snack foods. [21] [22] Breakfast is served all day, and there are two menus: one for breakfast, the other for lunch and dinner. Since the first restaurant opened, the menu has featured Southern specialties, including biscuits, fried chicken, and catfish; [5] seasonal and regional menu items were added during the 1980s and 1990s. [5] [12] In 2007, Cracker Barrel announced plans to remove artificial trans fats from its menu items. [23] [24] Locations, service, and decor [ edit ] A Cracker Barrel guest playing peg solitaire For much of its early history, Cracker Barrel decided to locate its restaurants along the Interstate Highway System , [5] and the majority of its restaurants remain close to interstate and other highways. [25] [26] [27] Cracker Barrel is known for the loyalty of its customers, [10] particularly travelers who are likely to spend more at restaurants than locals. [12] The locations are themed around the idea of a traditional Southern U.S. general store . Items used to decorate each store are authentic artifacts, [7] including everyday objects from the early 1900s and after. [28] Each restaurant features a front porch lined with wooden rocking chairs, a wooden peg solitaire game on every table, [29] and a stone fireplace with a deer head displayed above the mantel. [30] In fact, each location has five common items: a shotgun, a cookstove, a deer head, a telephone, and a traffic light. [31] The peg games have been present in Cracker Barrel since the opening of the first store, and continue to be produced by the same family in Lebanon, Tennessee. [32] The decor at each location typically includes artifacts related to the local history of the area, including antique household tools, old wall calendars and advertising posters, and antique photographs; [26] these are centrally stored in a warehouse in Tennessee, where they are cataloged and stockpiled for future use by individual store locations. [33] Awards [ edit ] Destinations magazine has presented the chain with awards for best chain restaurant, [34] and in 2010 and 2011, the Zagat survey named it the \"Best Breakfast\". [35] [36] The chain was selected by the Outdoor Advertising Association of America as the 2011 OBIE Hall of Fame Award recipient for its long-standing use of outdoor advertising. [37] It was also named the \"Best Family Dining\" restaurant by a nationwide \"Choice in Chains\" consumer poll in Restaurants & Institutions magazine for 19 consecutive years. [30] Corporate overview [ edit ] Investment and business model [ edit ] Cracker Barrel restaurants are aimed at the family and casual dining market as well as retail sales. [9] The chain also advertises to people traveling on the interstate highways, as the majority of its locations are close to highway exits. [11] The company has promoted its cost controls to investors. [38] [39] The company has stated its goal to keep employee turnover low, to provide better trained staff. [39] Since the 1980s, the firm has offered a formal training program with benefits for progressing through it to all of its employees. [5] [40] The board of directors of Cracker Barrel has repeatedly been at odds with the largest shareholder, Biglari Holdings Inc. [41] The owner of Biglari Holdings, Sardar Biglari, controls a 19.9% share of the company, [42] just short of the 20% needed to trigger a shareholder rights plan , more commonly termed a \"poison pill\". [43] The poison pill was adopted after Biglari Holdings sought approval to purchase a 49.99% share of the company and join the board of directors. [43] Biglari Holdings purchased shares of Cracker Barrel in 2011, and has been often critical of the transparency to shareholders, overspending on advertising, lack of customer value, [44] capital funds mismanagement, [45] and not maximizing shareholder value. [46] Biglari has requested to be on the board of directors three times, and has been denied each time by a vote of shareholders. [41] Biglari Holdings has also put forward a request for a one-time $20/share dividend to address perceived overly conservative capitalization, [46] which was also rejected by shareholders. [45] Cracker Barrel has responded by claiming Biglari has a \"hidden agenda\" and a conflict of interest by holding shares in other restaurant chains such as Steak 'n Shake . [47] [48] Community involvement [ edit ] Cracker Barrel has supported a wide range of charities through one-off donations, promotional events, and partnerships with charitable organizations. [49] The chain has supported charities and causes in communities where its restaurants are located, including the Gulf Coast after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 [50] and Nashville after severe flooding in 2010. In the same year, Cracker Barrel established Cracker Barrel Cares Inc., an employee-funded non-profit organization that provides support to Cracker Barrel employees. [51] Cracker Barrel has also formed a partnership with the Wounded Warrior Project , a charity for injured veterans. [52] In attempts to rebuild its image after several race -related controversies, [53] the firm has provided a scholarship through the National Black MBA Association , [54] and job skills programs and sponsorships with 100 Black Men of America [53] [55] and the Restaurant and Lodging Association. [56] Cracker Barrel sponsored the NASCAR Atlanta 500 race at Atlanta Motor Speedway from 1999 to 2001 [57] and the Grand Ole Opry from 2004 to 2009. The company was the first presenting sponsor of the Grand Ole Opry. [58] This sponsorship allowed the company to make connections within the Nashville music industry, following which it entered into partnership with a number of country music performers. [59] The chain has established partnerships with artists including Alison Krauss , Charlie Daniels , Josh Turner , Kenny Rogers , Dolly Parton , Alan Jackson , and Alabama , to offer CD releases and merchandise. [59] [60] [61] Controversies [ edit ] LGBT policies [ edit ] In early 1991, an intra-company memo called for employees to be dismissed if they did not display \"normal heterosexual values\". According to news reports, at least 11 employees were fired under the policy on a store-by-store basis from locations in Georgia and other states. [6] [12] After demonstrations by gay rights groups, the company ended its policy in March 1991 and stated it would not discriminate based on sexual orientation. [62] [63] The company's founder, Dan Evins, subsequently described the policy as a mistake. [6] From 1992 onward, [64] the New York City Employees Retirement System , then a major shareholder, put forward proposals to add sexual orientation to the company's non-discrimination policy. An early proposal in 1993 was defeated, with 77\u00a0percent against and only 14\u00a0percent in support, along with 9\u00a0percent abstaining. [65] It was not until 2002 that the proposals were successful; 58\u00a0percent of company shareholders voted in favor of the addition. [62] Cracker Barrel achieved the lowest score (15 out of 100) of all rated food and beverage companies in the Human Rights Campaign 's 2008 Corporate Equality Index , a measure of LGBT workplace equality. [66] Their score for 2011 had increased to a 55.  The 2011 survey noted that the firm had established a non-discrimination policy and had introduced diversity training that included training related to sexual orientation. [67] However, the company's score for 2013 dropped to a 35 out of 100, not having obtained the points related to non-discrimination toward gender identity and health benefits for partners of LGBT employees and transgender-inclusive benefits. [68] On December 20, 2013, Cracker Barrel announced it would no longer sell certain Duck Dynasty products which it was \"concerned might offend some of [its] guests\" [69] after Phil Robertson , a star of the reality TV show, remarked in a GQ interview [70] Don't be deceived. Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers\u2014they won't inherit the kingdom of God. Don't deceive yourself. It's not right. -- Duck Dynasty' s Phil Robertson Robertson also made \"comments likening homosexuality to terrorism and bestiality\" in the interview, and expressed views about race which attracted criticism. On December 22, less than two days after pulling the products from its shelves, Cracker Barrel reversed its position after protests from customers. [71] [72] [73] Race- and gender-based discrimination lawsuits [ edit ] In July 1999, a discrimination lawsuit was filed against Cracker Barrel by a group of former employees, who claimed that the company had discriminated against them on the grounds of race. [74] [75] In December 2001, twenty-one of the restaurant's customers, represented by the same attorneys, filed a separate lawsuit, alleging racial discrimination in its treatment of guests. [76] [77] [78] Regarding both accusations, Cracker Barrel officials disputed the claims and stated that the company was committed to fair treatment of its employees and customers. [75] [77] [79] In 2004, an investigation by the U.S. Justice Department found evidence that Cracker Barrel had been segregating customer seating by race; seating or serving white customers before seating or serving black customers; providing inferior service to black customers, and allowing white servers to refuse to serve black customers. [80] The Justice Department determined that the firm had violated Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . The company was required to sign a five-year agreement to introduce \"effective nondiscrimination policies and procedures.\" The terms included new equal opportunity training; the creation of a new system to log, investigate, and resolve complaints of discrimination; and  the publicizing of its non-discrimination policies. They were required to hire an outside auditor to ensure compliance with the terms of the settlement. [81] In 2006, Cracker Barrel paid a $2\u00a0million settlement to end a lawsuit alleging race and sexual harassment at three Illinois restaurants. [82] [83] Cracker Barrel stores subsequently began displaying a sign in the front foyer explaining the company's non-discrimination policy, [80] and added to its website and menu the policy and details on how to make a complaint. [84] Since the early 2000s, Cracker Barrel has provided training and resources to minority employees, to improve its image on diversity. These efforts involved outreach to minority employees, along with testing a training plan to help employees whose first language is Spanish to learn English. [53] As of  2002 [update] , minorities made up 23\u00a0percent of the company's employees, including over 11\u00a0percent of its management and executives. [54] Cracker Barrel is on the Corporate Advisory Board for the Texas Conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), [85] and is a corporate sponsor of the NAACP Leadership 500 Summit. [86] The company has been praised for its gender diversity, particularly on its board of directors , which includes three women out of eleven total board members. [87] Its chief executive officer (CEO), Sandra Cochran , is the second woman in Tennessee to hold that office in a publicly traded company. [87] Licensed products [ edit ] In November 2012, Cracker Barrel licensed its name to Smithfield Foods ' John Morrell Division in a deal to create a line of meat products to be sold in supermarkets and through other retail channels. In response, Kraft Foods filed a trademark-infringement lawsuit in February 2013. Kraft has sold cheese in retail stores under their Cracker Barrel brand since 1954. The corporation said that Cracker Barrel stores have not made significant sales of retail food products beyond their restaurant menu, and asked that the Smithfield Foods deal be nullified by the U.S. District Court in the Northern District of Illinois.

{"question": "in photosynthesis the carbon in co2 is initially fixed to what molecule", "answer": "", "context": "C4 carbon fixation - Wikipedia C 4 carbon fixation From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to: navigation , search Kranz anatomy allows C 4 carbon fixation. A: Mesophyll Cell B: Chloroplast C: Vascular Tissue D: Bundle Sheath Cell E: Stomate F: Vascular Tissue: provides continuous source of water 1) Carbon is fixed to produce oxaloacetate by PEP carboxylase. 2) The four carbon molecule then exits the cell and enters the chloroplasts of bundle sheath cells. 3) It is then broken down releasing carbon dioxide and producing pyruvate. Carbon dioxide combines with ribulose bisphosphate and proceeds to the Calvin Cycle. 4) Pyruvate re-enters the mesophyll cell. It then reacts with ATP to produce the beginning compound of the C4 cycle. C 4 carbon fixation or the Hatch-Slack pathway is a photosynthetic process in some plants. It is the first step in extracting carbon from carbon dioxide to be able to use it in sugar and other biomolecules. It is one of three known processes for carbon fixation . The C 4 in one of the names refers to the 4-carbon molecule that is the first product of this type of carbon fixation. C 4 fixation is an elaboration of the more common C 3 carbon fixation and is believed to have evolved more recently. C 4 overcomes the tendency of the enzyme RuBisCO to wastefully fix oxygen rather than carbon dioxide in the process of photorespiration . This is achieved by ensuring that RuBisCO works in an environment where there is a lot of carbon dioxide and very little oxygen. CO 2 is shuttled via malate or aspartate from mesophyll cells to bundle-sheath cells. In these bundle-sheath cells CO 2 is released by decarboxylation of the malate. C4 plants use PEP carboxylase to capture more CO 2 in the mesophyll cells. PEP Carboxylase (3 carbons) binds to CO 2 to make oxaloacetic acid (OAA). The OAA then makes malate (4 carbons). Malate enters bundle sheath cells and releases the CO 2 . These additional steps, however, require more energy in the form of ATP . Using this extra energy, C 4 plants are able to more efficiently fix carbon in drought, high temperatures, and limitations of nitrogen or CO 2 . Since the more common C 3 pathway does not require this extra energy, it is more efficient in the other conditions. The naming Hatch-Slack pathway is in honor of Marshall Davidson Hatch and C. R. Slack , who elucidated it in Australia in 1966. [1] Contents [ hide ] 1 C 4 pathway 2 C 4 Kranz leaf anatomy 3 The evolution and advantages of the C 4 pathway 4 Plants that use C 4 carbon fixation 4.1 Converting C 3 plants to C 4 5 See also 6 References 7 External links C 4 pathway [ edit ] NADP-ME type C 4 pathway NAD-ME type C 4 pathway PEPCK type C 4 pathway The first experiments indicating that some plants do not use C 3 carbon fixation but instead produce malate and aspartate in the first step of carbon fixation were done in the 1950s and early 1960s by Hugo P. Kortschak [2] and Yuri Karpilov . [3] The C 4 pathway was elucidated by Marshall Davidson Hatch and C. R. Slack, in Australia, in 1966; it is sometimes called the Hatch-Slack pathway. [4] In C 3 plants , the first step in the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis involves the fixation of CO 2 by the enzyme RuBisCO into 3-phosphoglycerate . However, due to the dual carboxylase and oxygenase activity of RuBisCo, some part of the substrate is oxidized rather than carboxylated , resulting in loss of substrate and consumption of energy, in what is known as photorespiration . In order to bypass the photorespiration pathway, C 4 plants have developed a mechanism to efficiently deliver CO 2 to the RuBisCO enzyme. They utilize their specific leaf anatomy where chloroplasts exist not only in the mesophyll cells in the outer part of their leaves but in the bundle sheath cells as well. Instead of direct fixation to RuBisCO in the Calvin cycle , CO 2 is incorporated into a 4-carbon organic acid , which has the ability to regenerate CO 2 in the chloroplasts of the bundle sheath cells. Bundle sheath cells can then utilize this CO 2 to generate carbohydrates by the conventional C 3 pathway . The first step in the pathway is the conversion of pyruvate to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), by the enzyme pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase . This reaction requires inorganic phosphate and ATP plus pyruvate , producing phosphoenolpyruvate , AMP , and inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi). The next step is the fixation of CO 2 into oxaloacetate by the enzyme PEP carboxylase . Both of these steps occur in the mesophyll cells: pyruvate + P i + ATP \u2192 PEP + AMP + PP i PEP + CO 2 \u2192 oxaloacetate PEP carboxylase has a lower Km for HCO \u2212 3 \u2014 and, hence, higher affinity \u2014 than RuBisCO. Furthermore, O 2 is a very poor substrate for this enzyme. Thus, at relatively low concentrations of CO 2 , most CO 2 will be fixed by this pathway. The product is usually converted to malate , a simple organic compound , which is transported to the bundle-sheath cells surrounding a nearby vein . Here, it is decarboxylated to produce CO 2 and pyruvate . The CO 2 now enters the Calvin cycle and the pyruvate is transported back to the mesophyll cell. Since every CO 2 molecule has to be fixed twice, first by 4-carbon organic acid and second by RuBisCO, the C 4 pathway uses more energy than the C 3 pathway. The C 3 pathway requires 18 molecules of ATP for the synthesis of one molecule of glucose, whereas the C 4 pathway requires 30 molecules of ATP. This energy debt is more than paid for by avoiding losing more than half of photosynthetic carbon in photorespiration as occurs in some tropical plants, [ citation needed ] making it an adaptive mechanism for minimizing the loss. There are several variants of this pathway: The 4-carbon acid transported from mesophyll cells may be malate, as above, or aspartate . The 3-carbon acid transported back from bundle-sheath cells may be pyruvate, as above, or alanine . The enzyme that catalyses decarboxylation in bundle-sheath cells differs. In maize and sugarcane, the enzyme is NADP-malic enzyme; in millet, it is NAD-malic enzyme; and, in Panicum maximum , it is PEP carboxykinase. C 4 Kranz leaf anatomy [ edit ] Cross section of a maize leaf, a C 4 plant. Kranz anatomy (rings of cells) shown. Drawing based on microscopic images courtesy of Cambridge University Plant Sciences Department. The C 4 plants often possess a characteristic leaf anatomy called kranz anatomy , from the German word for wreath . Their vascular bundles are surrounded by two rings of cells; the inner ring, called bundle sheath cells, contains starch -rich chloroplasts lacking grana, which differ from those in mesophyll cells present as the outer ring. Hence, the chloroplasts are called dimorphic. The primary function of kranz anatomy is to provide a site in which CO 2 can be concentrated around RuBisCO, thereby avoiding photorespiration . In order to maintain a significantly higher CO 2 concentration in the bundle sheath compared to the mesophyll, the boundary layer of the kranz has a low conductance to CO 2 , a property that may be enhanced by the presence of suberin . [5] Although most C 4 plants exhibit kranz anatomy, there are, however, a few species that operate a limited C 4 cycle without any distinct bundle sheath tissue. Suaeda aralocaspica , Bienertia cycloptera, Bienertia sinuspersici and Bienertia kavirense (all chenopods ) are terrestrial plants that inhabit dry, salty depressions in the deserts of the Middle East . These plants have been shown to operate single-cell C 4 CO 2 -concentrating mechanisms, which are unique among the known C 4 mechanisms. [6] [7] [8] [9] Although the cytology of both genera differs slightly, the basic principle is that fluid-filled vacuoles are employed to divide the cell into two separate areas. Carboxylation enzymes in the cytosol can, therefore, be kept separate from decarboxylase enzymes and RuBisCO in the chloroplasts, and a diffusive barrier can be established between the chloroplasts (which contain RuBisCO) and the cytosol. This enables a bundle-sheath-type area and a mesophyll-type area to be established within a single cell. Although this does allow a limited C 4 cycle to operate, it is relatively inefficient, with the occurrence of much leakage of CO 2 from around RuBisCO. There is also evidence for the exhibiting of inducible C 4 photosynthesis by non-kranz aquatic macrophyte Hydrilla verticillata under warm conditions, although the mechanism by which CO 2 leakage from around RuBisCO is minimised is currently uncertain. [10] The evolution and advantages of the C 4 pathway [ edit ] Further information: Evolutionary history of plants \u00a7\u00a0Evolution of photosynthetic pathways C 4 plants have a competitive advantage over plants possessing the more common C 3 carbon fixation pathway under conditions of drought , high temperatures , and nitrogen or CO 2 limitation. When grown in the same environment, at 30\u00a0\u00b0C, C 3 grasses lose approximately 833 molecules of water per CO 2 molecule that is fixed, whereas C 4 grasses lose only 277. This increased water use efficiency of C 4 grasses means that soil moisture is conserved, allowing them to grow for longer in arid environments. [11] C 4 carbon fixation has evolved on up to 61 independent occasions in 19 different families of plants, making it a prime example of convergent evolution . [12] This convergence may have been facilitated by the fact that many potential evolutionary pathways to a C 4 phenotype exist, many of which involve initial evolutionary steps not directly related to photosynthesis. [13] C 4 plants arose around 35 million years ago [12] during the Oligocene (precisely when is difficult to determine) and did not become ecologically significant until around 6\u00a0to\u00a07 million years ago , in the Miocene Period . [14] C 4 metabolism originated when grasses migrated from the shady forest undercanopy to more open environments, [15] where the high sunlight gave it an advantage over the C 3 pathway. [16] Drought was not necessary for its innovation; rather, the increased resistance to water stress was a by-product of the pathway and allowed C 4 plants to more readily colonise arid environments. [16] Today, C 4 plants represent about 5% of Earth's plant biomass and 3% of its known plant species. [11] [17] Despite this scarcity, they account for about 23% of terrestrial carbon fixation. [14] [18] Increasing the proportion of C 4 plants on earth could assist biosequestration of CO 2 and represent an important climate change avoidance strategy. Present-day C 4 plants are concentrated in the tropics and subtropics (below latitudes of 45\u00b0) where the high air temperature contributes to higher possible levels of oxygenase activity by RuBisCO, which increases rates of photorespiration in C 3 plants. Plants that use C 4 carbon fixation [ edit ] Maize (or corn) is a common C4 plant. About 8,100 plant species use C 4 carbon fixation, which represents about 3% of all terrestrial species of plants. [18] [19] All these 8,100 species are angiosperms . C 4 carbon fixation is less common in dicots than in monocots , with only 4.5% of dicots using the C 4 pathway, compared to 40% of monocots. Despite this, only three families of monocots utilise C 4 carbon fixation compared to 15 dicot families. Of the monocot clades containing C 4 plants, the grass ( Poaceae ) species use the C 4 photosynthetic pathway most. Forty-six percent of grasses are C 4 and together account for 61% of C 4 species. These include the food crops maize , sugar cane , millet , and sorghum . [20] [21] Of the dicot clades containing C 4 species, the order Caryophyllales contains the most species. Of the families in the Caryophyllales, the Chenopodiaceae use C 4 carbon fixation the most, with 550 out of 1,400 species using it. About 250 of the 1000 species of the related Amaranthaceae also use C 4 . [11] [22] Members of the sedge family Cyperaceae , and members of numerous families of Eudicots -including Asteraceae (the daisy family), Brassicaceae (the cabbage family), and Euphorbiaceae (the spurge family)- also use C 4 . Trees which use C 4 include Paulownia . Converting C 3 plants to C 4 [ edit ] Given the advantages of C 4 , a group of scientists from institutions around the world are working on the C 4 Rice Project to turn rice , a C 3 plant, into a C 4 plant by studying the C 4 plants maize and Brachypodium . [23] As rice is the world's most important human food\u2014it is the staple food for more than half the planet\u2014having rice that is more efficient at converting sunlight into grain could have significant global benefits towards improving food security . The team claim C 4 rice could produce up to 50% more grain\u2014and be able to do it with less water and nutrients. [24] [25] [26] The researchers have already identified genes needed for C 4 photosynthesis in rice and are now looking towards developing a prototype C 4 rice plant. In 2012, the Government of the United Kingdom along with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation provided $14 million over 3 years towards the C 4 Rice Project at the International Rice Research Institute .
